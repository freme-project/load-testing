Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoringon the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicatesof Mr. Rucastle's.""You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Nowlead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this blackbusiness."We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down apassage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which MissHunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed thetransverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, butwithout success. No sound came from within, and at the silenceHolmes' face clouded over."I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, MissHunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, putyour shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make ourway in."It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our unitedstrength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. Therewas no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and abasketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisonergone."There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beautyhas guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victimoff."
