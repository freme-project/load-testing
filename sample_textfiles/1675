"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
 play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
 that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,
 the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will
 be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
