the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope wasthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole andcoming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor wasfurnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that Iwas probably on the right track. The idea of using a form ofpoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemicaltest was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthlessman who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which sucha poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, bean advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who coulddistinguish the two little dark punctures which would show wherethe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of thewhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morninglight revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably bythe use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that hethought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down therope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite theoccupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, butsooner or later she must fall a victim."I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered hisroom. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been inthe habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessaryin order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of thesafe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough tofinally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallicclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfatherhastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
