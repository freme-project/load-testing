for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lowerpart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestiveof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy."You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and astrongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." Helooked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which toaddress."Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend andcolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help mein my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?""You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honourand discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the mostextreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicatewith you alone."I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed meback into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may saybefore this gentleman anything which you may say to me."The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," saidhe, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; atthe end of that time the matter will be of no importance. Atpresent it is not too much to say that it is of such weight itmay have an influence upon European history."
