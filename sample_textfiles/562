complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed anddevotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when sheheard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, thereason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that Ifeared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came toMr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured topush her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards mywife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen thepossibility of something of the sort, and I had two policefellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making arow.""Did your wife hear all this?""No, thank goodness, she did not.""And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?""Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon asso serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laidsome terrible trap for her.""Well, it is a possible supposition.""You think so, too?""I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look uponthis as likely?"
