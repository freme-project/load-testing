day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story wereabsolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutelyunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred betweenthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It wassomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not thenature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, whichcontained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon'sdeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the leftparietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had beenshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spotupon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck frombehind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as whenseen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, itdid not go for very much, for the older man might have turned hisback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to callHolmes' attention to it.

What atissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! Idid not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
