There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen someyears back, and something on very much the same lines at Munichthe year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of thesecases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there arecigars in the box."The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried ablack canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seatedhimself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him."What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "Youlook dissatisfied.""And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriagecase. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.""Really! You surprise me.""Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slipthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.""And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying hishand upon the arm of the pea-jacket."Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
