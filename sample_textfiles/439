by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself inthe bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which wasweighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it fromthe leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out ofthe window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clotheswould have followed, but at that moment there was a rush ofconstables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer."I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. Iwas determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, andhence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife wouldbe terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to theLascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, togetherwith a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause tofear.""That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes."Good God! What a week she must have spent!""The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult topost a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailorcustomer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.""That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubtof it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
