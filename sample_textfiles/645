and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waitingoutside."'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that itmust be when I saw the door open.'"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted."'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think howcaressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightenedyou, my dear young lady?'"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. Iwas keenly on my guard against him."'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I wasfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still inthere!'"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly."'Why, what did you think?' I asked."'Why do you think that I lock this door?'"'I am sure that I do not know.'"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do yousee?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
