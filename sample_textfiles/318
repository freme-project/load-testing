Leadenhall Street--and--""What office?""That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know.""Where did he live, then?""He slept on the premises.""And you don't know his address?""No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.""Where did you address your letters, then?""To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till calledfor. He said that if they were sent to the office he would bechaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn'thave that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to comefrom me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that themachine had come between us. That will just show you how fond hewas of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would thinkof.""It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiomof mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
