September 12thIt is past; I am returning to England.  I have lost my hopes of utilityand glory; I have lost my friend.  But I will endeavour to detail thesebitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am waftedtowards England and towards you, I will not despond.September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder wereheard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in everydirection.  We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could onlyremain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guestwhose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confinedto his bed.  The ice cracked behind us and was driven with forcetowards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th thepassage towards the south became perfectly free.  When the sailors sawthis and that their return to their native country was apparentlyassured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud andlong-continued.  Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked thecause of the tumult.  "They shout," I said, "because they will soonreturn to England.""Do you, then, really return?""Alas!  Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.  I cannot lead themunwillingly to danger, and I must return."
