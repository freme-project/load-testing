was my first impression. At the second glance, however, Iperceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking inmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there areusually people there. This man, however, was leaning against therailings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. Ilowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find hereyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in myhand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once."'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon theroad there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'"'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked."'No, I know no one in these parts.'"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion tohim to go away.'"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turnround and wave him away like that.'"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drewdown the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I havenot sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, norseen the man in the road."
