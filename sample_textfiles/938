have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?
 Do you dare to break your promise?  I have endured toil and misery; I
 left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
 its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.  I have dwelt
 many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.
