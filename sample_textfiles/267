Oh!  No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.  A mummy
 again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.  I
 had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
 muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing
 such as even Dante could not have conceived.
