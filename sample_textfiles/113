this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed inimitation of the Eastern authors.  Through this work I obtained acursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires atpresent existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners,governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.  Iheard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mentalactivity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the earlyRomans--of their subsequent degenerating--of the decline of that mightyempire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.  I heard of the discoveryof the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate ofits original inhabitants."These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.  Wasman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet sovicious and base?  He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evilprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble andgodlike.  To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honourthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many onrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition moreabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.  For a long time Icould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, oreven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details ofvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust andloathing."Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon theArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.  Iheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalidpoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
