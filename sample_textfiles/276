"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size largerthan your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are moredeveloped.""Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?""I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, youuse an arc-and-compass breastpin.""Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?""What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny forfive inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near theelbow where you rest it upon the desk?""Well, but China?""The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your rightwrist could only have been done in China. I have made a smallstudy of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literatureof the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of adelicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, Isee a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matterbecomes even more simple."Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "Ithought at first that you had done something clever, but I seethat there was nothing in it, after all."
