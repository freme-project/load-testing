"Were they all fastened this morning?""Yes.""You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarkedto your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?""Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, andwho may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet.""I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell hersweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.""But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried thebanker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur withthe coronet in his hands?""Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About thisgirl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, Ipresume?""Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night Imet her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.""Do you know him?""Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.His name is Francis Prosper."
