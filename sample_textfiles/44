expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the
 picture.  Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity:
 I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to
 support my spirits.  I love you very tenderly.  Remember me with
 affection, should you never hear from me again.
