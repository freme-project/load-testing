pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side ofthe bed, and you in that chair."I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed uponthe bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and thestump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were leftin darkness.How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear asound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that mycompanion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the samestate of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cutoff the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once atour very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us thatthe cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear thedeep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter ofan hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, andone and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently forwhatever might befall.Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in thedirection of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but wassucceeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentlesound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though thesmell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.
