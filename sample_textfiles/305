The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound ofrending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashedupon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop camedown on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stonefloor."It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have nochance at all.""So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancythat my pal is all right, though I see you have got hiscoat-tails.""There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes."Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. Imust compliment you.""And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very newand effective.""You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quickerat climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix thederbies."
