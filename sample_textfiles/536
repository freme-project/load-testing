broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. Foran instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a doorwhich led away from death. The next instant I threw myselfthrough, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel hadclosed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a fewmoments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told mehow narrow had been my escape."I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, andI found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friendwhose warning I had so foolishly rejected."'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in amoment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not wastethe so-precious time, but come!'"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered tomy feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a windingstair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as wereached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting oftwo voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  wewere and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked abouther like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a doorwhich led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moonwas shining brightly."'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may bethat you can jump it.'
