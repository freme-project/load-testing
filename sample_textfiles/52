"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a littlegossip concerning the good people of Geneva.  The pretty Miss Mansfieldhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approachingmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.  Her uglysister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Yourfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunessince the departure of Clerval from Geneva.  But he has alreadyrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying alively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.  She is a widow, and mucholder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite witheverybody."I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxietyreturns upon me as I conclude.  Write, dearest Victor,--one line--oneword will be a blessing to us.  Ten thousand thanks to Henry for hiskindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerelygrateful.  Adieu!  my cousin; take care of your self; and, I entreatyou, write!"Elizabeth Lavenza."Geneva, March 18, 17--.""Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter:  "Iwill write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel."I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescencehad commenced, and proceeded regularly.  In another fortnight I wasable to leave my chamber.
