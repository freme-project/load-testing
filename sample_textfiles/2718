Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number
 merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did
 rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
 wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
 which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.
