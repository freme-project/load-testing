"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a
 consent from me.  You may render me the most miserable of men, but you
 shall never make me base in my own eyes.  Shall I create another like
 yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.  Begone!  I
 have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent."
