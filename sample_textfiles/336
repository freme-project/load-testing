"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the oldPersian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tigercub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as muchknowledge of the world."ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERYWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when themaid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ranin this way:"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for fromthe west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.Leave Paddington by the 11:15.""What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me."Will you go?""I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list atpresent.""Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been lookinga little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."
