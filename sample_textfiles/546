believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed tothe general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had aconsiderable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that nomemoir of him would be complete without some little sketch ofthis remarkable episode.It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when Iwas still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he camehome from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the tablewaiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weatherhad taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, andthe Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs asa relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I hadsurrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside andlay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon theenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend'snoble correspondent could be."Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered."Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from afish-monger and a tide-waiter.""Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," heanswered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the moreinteresting. This looks like one of those unwelcome socialsummonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
