corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any replyfrom within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at hisheels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood adark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliantbeam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylottclad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protrudingbeneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which wehad noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and hiseyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of theceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, withbrownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round hishead. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion."The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear beganto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squatdiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent."It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake inIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violencedoes, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer fallsinto the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust thiscreature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner tosome place of shelter and let the county police know what hashappened."
