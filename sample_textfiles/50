But success SHALL crown my endeavours.  Wherefore not?  Thus far I have
 gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
 themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.  Why not
 still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?  What can stop the
 determined heart and resolved will of man?
