and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
 life of its creator;--has this mind perished?  Does it now only exist
 in my memory?  No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
 beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
 consoles your unhappy friend.
