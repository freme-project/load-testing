deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.""I swear," he cried, "by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and bythe fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer,while they exist you shall never behold me again.  Depart to your homeand commence your labours; I shall watch their progress withunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shallappear."Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change inmy sentiments.  I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed thanthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of thesea of ice.His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge ofthe horizon when he departed.  I knew that I ought to hasten my descenttowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but myheart was heavy, and my steps slow.  The labour of winding among thelittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advancedperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrencesof the day had produced.  Night was far advanced when I came to thehalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.  The starsshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pinesrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on theground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strangethoughts within me.  I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, Iexclaimed, "Oh!  Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mockme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become asnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness."
