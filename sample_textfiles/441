Amid the action and reaction of sodense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of eventsmay be expected to take place, and many a little problem will bepresented which may be striking and bizarre without beingcriminal. We have already had experience of such.""So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which Ihave added to my notes, three have been entirely free of anylegal crime."
