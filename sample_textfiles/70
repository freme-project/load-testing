innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated bythousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise haveexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by theimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.  Shewas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and asher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, sheworked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered thecourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we wereseated.  A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quicklyrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attesther utter guiltlessness.The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated thecharge, several witnesses were called.  Several strange facts combinedagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proofof her innocence as I had.  She had been out the whole of the night onwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had beenperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of themurdered child had been afterwards found.  The woman asked her what shedid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confusedand unintelligible answer.  She returned to the house about eighto'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, shereplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestlyif anything had been heard concerning him.  When shown the body, shefell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.  Thepicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the samewhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed roundhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
