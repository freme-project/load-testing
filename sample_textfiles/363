I shall be busy this afternoon,and shall probably return to London by the evening train.""And leave your case unfinished?""No, finished.""But the mystery?""It is solved.""Who was the criminal, then?""The gentleman I describe.""But who is he?""Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such apopulous neighbourhood."Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said,"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country lookingfor a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become thelaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.""All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line beforeI leave."
