it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay backwithout wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time."How is that?" I asked when I had finished."Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.""Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidentlytrying to your nerves.""Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincingevidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if theybelieved my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and Ihave not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are sovague that it is a question whether justice will be done.""Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problemwhich you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend youto come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to theofficial police.""Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and Ishould be very glad if he would take the matter up, though ofcourse I must use the official police as well. Would you give mean introduction to him?""I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
