"Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me?  And do not you fear
 the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?  Begone,
 vile insect!  Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!  And,
 oh!  That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence,
 restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!"
