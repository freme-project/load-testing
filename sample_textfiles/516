are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itselfa monotonous occupation.""Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, andlaughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medicalinstincts rose up against that laugh."Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured outsome water from a caraffe.It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hystericaloutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisisis over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, veryweary and pale-looking."I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped."Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water,and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks."That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you wouldkindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumbused to be."He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave evenmy hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were fourprotruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where thethumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out fromthe roots.
