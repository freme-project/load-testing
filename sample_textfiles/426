"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is ahuge error which it may take some little time to rectify.Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leafof a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day inGravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has beengummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had beenchewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband'shand, madam?""None. Neville wrote those words.""And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that thedanger is over.""But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.""Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken fromhim.""No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!""Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and onlyposted to-day.""That is possible.""If so, much may have happened between."
