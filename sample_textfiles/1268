consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.  Hypocritical
 fiend!  If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object,
 again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.  It is not
 pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your
 malignity is withdrawn from your power."
