purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to havevengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of thatbuilding, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell somestrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonlessnights.""What! You do not mean bodies?""Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 poundsfor every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. Itis the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear thatNeville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But ourtrap should be here." He put his two forefingers between histeeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by asimilar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattleof wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs."Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up throughthe gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light fromits side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?""If I can be of use.""Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler stillmore so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.""The Cedars?""Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while Iconduct the inquiry."
