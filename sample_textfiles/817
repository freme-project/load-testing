become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.  My vices
 are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
 necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.  I shall feel
 the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
 existence and events from which I am now excluded."
