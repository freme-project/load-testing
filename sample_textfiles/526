enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now beendoing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations weerected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have alreadyexplained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon thesubject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if itonce became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to ourlittle house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the factscame out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting thesefields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made youpromise me that you will not tell a human being that you aregoing to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could notquite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic pressin excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug outlike gravel from a pit.'"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compressthe earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealingwhat they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fullyinto my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how Itrust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, atEyford at 11:15.'"'I shall certainly be there.'"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dankgrasp, he hurried from the room.
