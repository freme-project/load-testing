down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsinghamde Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. WasUnder-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. TheDuke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor onthe distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive inall this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for somethingmore solid.""I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me asremarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knewthat you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked theintrusion of other matters.""Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Squarefurniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, itwas obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of yournewspaper selections.""Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personalcolumn of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeksback: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, ifrumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord RobertSt. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss HattyDoran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of SanFrancisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
