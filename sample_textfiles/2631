We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
 zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
 stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
 a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
 helping a boy to put up the shutters.
