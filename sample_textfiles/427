"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all iswell with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that Ishould know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw himlast he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-roomrushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty thatsomething had happened. Do you think that I would respond to sucha trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?""I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a womanmay be more valuable than the conclusion of an analyticalreasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strongpiece of evidence to corroborate your view.

It is unthinkable.""And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?""No.""And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?""Very much so.""Was the window open?""Yes.""Then he might have called to you?"
