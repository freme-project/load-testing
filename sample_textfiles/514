set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when thefacts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clearsgradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leadson to the complete truth.

I had returnedto civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his BakerStreet rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionallyeven persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to comeand visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as Ihappened to live at no very great distance from PaddingtonStation, I got a few patients from among the officials. One ofthese, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, wasnever weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to sendme on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened bythe maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had comefrom Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. Idressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway caseswere seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, myold ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the doortightly behind him."I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over hisshoulder; "he's all right."
