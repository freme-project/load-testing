composed of wood.  I quickly collected some branches, but they were wetand would not burn.  I was pained at this and sat still watching theoperation of the fire.  The wet wood which I had placed near the heatdried and itself became inflamed.  I reflected on this, and by touchingthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself incollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have aplentiful supply of fire.  When night came on and brought sleep withit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.  Icovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branchesupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sankinto sleep."It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.

When night came again Ifound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and thatthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I foundsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, andtasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.
