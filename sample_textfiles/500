He took up a small saucer of milk whichstood on the top of it."No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.""Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet asaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, Idaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." Hesquatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seatof it with the greatest attention."Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and puttinghis lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung onone corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itselfand tied so as to make a loop of whipcord."What do you make of that, Watson?""It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should betied."
