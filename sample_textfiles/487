"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.""Why, what do you mean?"For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace whichfringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five littlelivid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printedupon the white wrist."You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "Heis a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his ownstrength."There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chinupon his hands and stared into the crackling fire."This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are athousand details which I should desire to know before I decideupon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. Ifwe were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible forus to see over these rooms without the knowledge of yourstepfather?""As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon somemost important business. It is probable that he will be away allday, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have ahousekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easilyget her out of the way."
