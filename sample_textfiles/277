"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistakein explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and mypoor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if Iam so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?""Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red fingerplanted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what beganit all. You just read it for yourself, sir."I took the paper from him and read as follows:"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the lateEzekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is nowanother vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to asalary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. Allred-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the ageof twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, ateleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7Pope's Court, Fleet Street.""What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twiceread over the extraordinary announcement.Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit whenin high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell usall about yourself, your household, and the effect which thisadvertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,Doctor, of the paper and the date."
