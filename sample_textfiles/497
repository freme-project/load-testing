lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, builtfirmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching hischin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents somedifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they werebolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light uponthe matter."A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from whichthe three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the thirdchamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which MissStoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with herfate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and agaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. Abrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrowwhite-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on theleft-hand side of the window. These articles, with two smallwicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room savefor a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round andthe panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so oldand discoloured that it may have dated from the original buildingof the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and satsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,taking in every detail of the apartment."Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at lastpointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, thetassel actually lying upon the pillow."It goes to the housekeeper's room."
