I am interrupted.  What do these sounds portend?  It is midnight; the
 breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.  Again there
 is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
 where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.  I must arise and examine.
 Good night, my sister.
