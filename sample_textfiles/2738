Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you
 helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
 your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,
 too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
 which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
