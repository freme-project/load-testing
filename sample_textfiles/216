between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered pieceof ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me ahideous death.  In this manner many appalling hours passed; several ofmy dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation ofdistress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth tome hopes of succour and life.  I had no conception that vessels evercame so far north and was astounded at the sight.  I quickly destroyedpart of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled,with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of yourship.  I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trustmyself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.  Ihoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue myenemy.  But your direction was northwards.  You took me on board whenmy vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under mymultiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task isunfulfilled.Oh!

And do I dare to ask of you toundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?No; I am not so selfish.  Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, ifthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that heshall not live--swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulatedwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.  He is eloquentand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; buttrust him not.  His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treacheryand fiend-like malice.  Hear him not; call on the names of William,Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and
