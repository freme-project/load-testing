the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch themost fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant thatI had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriagedrove away."It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbledabout looking for matches and muttering under his breath.Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and along, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grewbroader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which sheheld above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with whichthe light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a richmaterial. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone asthough asking a question, and when my companion answered in agruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearlyfell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whisperedsomething in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the roomfrom whence she had come, he walked towards me again with thelamp in his hand."'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for afew minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was aquiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in thecentre, on which several German books were scattered. ColonelStark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside thedoor. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, andvanished into the darkness.
