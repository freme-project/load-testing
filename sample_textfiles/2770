"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three
 in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,
 and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps
 from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would
 just ask you whether you had heard it.'
