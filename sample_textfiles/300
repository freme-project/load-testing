your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
 guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
 your poor cousin.  Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed
 you are getting better.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this
 intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
