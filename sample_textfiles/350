Herviolet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon hercheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in heroverpowering excitement and concern."Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to theother of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. Ihave driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known eachother since we were little children, and I know his faults as noone else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such acharge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.""I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes."You may rely upon my doing all that I can.""But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourselfthink that he is innocent?""I think that it is very probable."
