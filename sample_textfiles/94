Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to mytouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, withno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.  The lightbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as Iwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.  This was theforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook restingfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.  Thisroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which Ifound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.  I slaked my thirstat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep."It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as itwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.  Before I had quittedyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with someclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews ofnight.  I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and coulddistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I satdown and wept."Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation ofpleasure.  I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among thetrees.  [The moon]  I gazed with a kind of wonder.  It moved slowly,but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, withwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.  No distinctideas occupied my mind; all was confused.  I felt light, and hunger,and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and onall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I coulddistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that withpleasure.
