"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was verymuch astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commissionwhich had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I wasglad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have askedhad I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible thatthis order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the faceand manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression uponme, and I could not think that his explanation of thefuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for mycoming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tellanyone of my errand.

I was theonly passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon theplatform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passedout through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance ofthe morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without aword he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the doorof which was standing open. He drew up the windows on eitherside, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as thehorse could go.""One horse?" interjected Holmes."Yes, only one."
