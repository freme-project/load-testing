the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine bigone, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its billopen, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my fingercould reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone passalong its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flappedand struggled, and out came my sister to know what was thematter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose andfluttered off among the others."'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she."'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and Iwas feeling which was the fattest.'"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, wecall it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-sixof them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozenfor the market.'"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and wefattened it expressly for you.'"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I."'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is ityou want, then?'
