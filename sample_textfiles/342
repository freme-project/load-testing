To take the first example to hand, I very clearlyperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-handside, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have notedeven so self-evident a thing as that.""How on earth--""My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatnesswhich characterises you. You shave every morning, and in thisseason you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is lessand less complete as we get farther back on the left side, untilit becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of thejaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminatedthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits lookingat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such aresult. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation andinference. Therein lies my m√©tier, and it is just possible thatit may be of some service in the investigation which lies beforeus. There are one or two minor points which were brought out inthe inquest, and which are worth considering.""What are they?""It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but afterthe return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabularyinforming him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was notsurprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.This observation of his had the natural effect of removing anytraces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of thecoroner's jury."
