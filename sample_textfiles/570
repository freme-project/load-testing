little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humblelodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of coldwoodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group ofancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the ArabianNights, with no explanation save that the things had been paidfor and were ordered to this address.Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into theroom. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in hiseye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in hisconclusions."They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands."You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.""Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "Iam surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! Ifancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a veryperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features."My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes."Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.Have you good authority for what you say?"
