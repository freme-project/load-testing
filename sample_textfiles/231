made.  You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they areconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.  Hypocriticalfiend!  If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object,again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.  It is notpity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of yourmalignity is withdrawn from your power.""Oh, it is not thus--not thus," interrupted the being.  "Yet such mustbe the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport ofmy actions.  Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.  No sympathymay I ever find.  When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue,the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole beingoverflowed, that I wished to be participated.  But now that virtue hasbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned intobitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?  I amcontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, Iam well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and ofenjoyment.  Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning myoutward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I wascapable of unfolding.  I was nourished with high thoughts of honour anddevotion.  But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. Noguilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable tomine.  When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannotbelieve that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filledwith sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty ofgoodness.  But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignantdevil.  Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associatesin his desolation; I am alone.
