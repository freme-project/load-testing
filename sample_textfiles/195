wonder that I survive what I have endured.  I will confide this tale ofmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.  Butuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.  This I mostearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply."In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter we returned toGeneva.  The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears werein her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish  cheeks.  Isaw a change in her also.  She was thinner and had lost much of thatheavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness andsoft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blastedand miserable as I was.  The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did notendure.  Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what hadpassed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burntwith rage, sometimes low and despondent.  I neither spoke nor looked atanyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseriesthat overcame me.Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentlevoice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me withhuman feelings when sunk in torpor.  She wept with me and for me.  Whenreason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me withresignation.  Ah!  It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, butfor the guilty there is no peace.  The agonies of remorse poison theluxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess ofgrief.  Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriagewith Elizabeth.  I remained silent."Have you, then, some other attachment?"
