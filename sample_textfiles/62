Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.  Nightalso closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, Ifelt still more gloomily.  The picture appeared a vast and dim scene ofevil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the mostwretched of human beings.  Alas!  I prophesied truly, and failed onlyin one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined anddreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I wasdestined to endure.  It was completely dark when I arrived in theenvirons of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I wasobliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance ofhalf a league from the city.  The sky was serene; and, as I was unableto rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had beenmurdered.  As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to crossthe lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.  During this short voyageI saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the mostbeautiful figures.  The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, onlanding, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.  Itadvanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain comingslowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and stormincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crashover my head.  It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps ofSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating thelake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instantevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itselffrom the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case inSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.  Themost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of thelake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of
