husband's writing, madam.""No, but the enclosure is.""I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to goand inquire as to the address.""How can you tell that?""The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has drieditself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows thatblotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straightoff, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. Thisman has written the name, and there has then been a pause beforehe wrote the address, which can only mean that he was notfamiliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there isnothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!there has been an enclosure here!""Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.""And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?""One of his hands.""One?""His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usualwriting, and yet I know it well."
