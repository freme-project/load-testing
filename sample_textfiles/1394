Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but
 built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock
 to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well
 furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those
 preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
