others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings thatoppressed me.  I escaped from them to the room where lay the body ofElizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.  Shehad been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, andnow, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown acrossher face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towardsher and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldnessof the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to bethe Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.  The murderous mark ofthe fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issuefrom her lips.  While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, Ihappened to look up.  The windows of the room had before been darkened,and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moonilluminate the chamber.  The shutters had been thrown back, and with asensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window afigure the most hideous and abhorred.  A grin was on the face of themonster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointedtowards the corpse of my wife.  I rushed towards the window, anddrawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped fromhis station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged intothe lake.The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed tothe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track withboats; nets were cast, but in vain.  After passing several hours, wereturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been aform conjured up by my fancy.  After having landed, they proceeded tosearch the country, parties going in different directions among thewoods and vines.
