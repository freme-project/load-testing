would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed hiswhole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, andI shall continue with my miserable story."When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night afterdinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precioustreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the nameof my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I amsure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famouscoronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it."'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur."'In my own bureau.'"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during thenight.' said he."'It is locked up,' I answered."'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster Ihave opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little ofwhat he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night witha very grave face.
