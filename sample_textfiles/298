grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thoughtover it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headedcopier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-CoburgSquare, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint fromHolmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was aformidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried topuzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter asideuntil night should bring an explanation.It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made myway across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to BakerStreet. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I enteredthe passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On enteringhis room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official policeagent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with avery shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat."Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up hispea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack."Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let meintroduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion into-night's adventure.""We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones inhis consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man forstarting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to dothe running down."
