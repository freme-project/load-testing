"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes."Married! When?""Yesterday.""But to whom?""To an English lawyer named Norton.""But she could not love him.""I am in hopes that she does.""And why in hopes?""Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of futureannoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love yourMajesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reasonwhy she should interfere with your Majesty's plan.""It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my ownstation! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into amoody silence, which was not broken until we drew up inSerpentine Avenue.The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stoodupon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we steppedfrom the brougham.
