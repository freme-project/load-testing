sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet shehas committed a murder."Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to seemy cousin.  My father wished her not to go but said that he left it toher own judgment and feelings to decide.  "Yes," said Elizabeth, "Iwill go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; Icannot go alone."  The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet Icould not refuse.  We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheldJustine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands weremanacled, and her head rested on her knees.  She rose on seeing usenter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at thefeet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.  My cousin wept also."Oh, Justine!" said she.  "Why did you rob me of my last consolation?I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, Iwas not so miserable as I am now.""And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?  Do you alsojoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?" Hervoice was suffocated with sobs."Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth; "why do you kneel, if you areinnocent?  I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless,notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourselfdeclared your guilt.  That report, you say, is false; and be assured,dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment,but your own confession."
