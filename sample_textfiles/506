Two hourspassed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke ofeleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us."That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "itcomes from the middle window."As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. Amoment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowingin our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of usthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, forunrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.
