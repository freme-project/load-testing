the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon hiswaterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather tohimself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice hewas walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles aredeeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out hisstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here arethe father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? Itis the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quiteunusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of coursethat was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran upand down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until wewere well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of agreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes tracedhis way to the farther side of this and lay down once more uponhis face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time heremained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope andexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark ofthe tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying amongthe moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Thenhe followed a pathway through the wood until he came to thehighroad, where all traces were lost."It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house onthe right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have aword with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having donethat, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,and I shall be with you presently."
