destroy my hopes?""Begone!  I do break my promise; never will I create another likeyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.""Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourselfunworthy of my condescension.  Remember that I have power; you believeyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light ofday will be hateful to you.  You are my creator, but I am your master;obey!""The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power isarrived.  Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; butthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion invice.  Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whosedelight is in death and wretchedness?  Begone!  I am firm, and yourwords will only exasperate my rage."The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth inthe impotence of anger.  "Shall each man," cried he, "find a wife forhis bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?  I hadfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.Man!  You may hate, but beware!  Your hours will pass in dread andmisery, and soon the bolt  will fall which must ravish from you yourhappiness forever.  Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensityof my wretchedness?  You can blast my other passions, but revengeremains--revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!  I may die, butfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes onyour misery.  Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.  I willwatch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.
