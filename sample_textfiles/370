incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches ofsuch a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to bein his power."It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chapthen, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand atanything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luckwith my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what youwould call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, andwe had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from timeto time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our partyis still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang."One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, andwe lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopersand six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four oftheir saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head ofthe wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to theLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw hiswicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember everyfeature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and madeour way over to England without being suspected. There I partedfrom my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet andrespectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be inthe market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
