at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on theisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; andnow that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and thatvillage half hid in the recess of the mountain.  Oh, surely the spiritthat inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with manthan those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks ofthe mountains of our own country." Clerval!  Beloved friend!  Even nowit delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of whichyou are so eminently deserving.  He was a being formed in the "verypoetry of nature." His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastenedby the sensibility of his heart.  His soul overflowed with ardentaffections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous naturethat the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. Buteven human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind.The scenery of external nature, which others regard only withadmiration, he loved with ardour:--     ----The sounding cataract     Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,     The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,     Their colours and their forms, were then to him     An appetite; a feeling, and a love,     That had no need of a remoter charm,     By thought supplied, or any interest     Unborrow'd from the eye.                    [Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey".]
