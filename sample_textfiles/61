longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends;but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.  I couldhardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.  Ipassed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seenfor nearly six years.  How altered every thing might be during thattime!  One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousandlittle circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations,which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the lessdecisive.  Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousandnameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to definethem.  I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.I contemplated the lake:  the waters were placid; all around was calm;and the snowy mountains, 'the palaces of nature,' were not changed.  Bydegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued myjourney towards Geneva.The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as Iapproached my native town.  I discovered more distinctly the blacksides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.  I wept like achild.  "Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome yourwanderer?  Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue andplacid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?"I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling onthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparativehappiness, and I think of them with pleasure.  My country, my belovedcountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in againbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovelylake!
