find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my
 bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the
 mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I
 blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little
 resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
