profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was thestepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,but that the one always appeared when the other was away, wassuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. Mysuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action intypewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that hishandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise eventhe smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,together with many minor ones, all pointed in the samedirection.""And how did you verify them?""Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. Iknew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printeddescription. I eliminated everything from it which could be theresult of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and Isent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform mewhether it answered to the description of any of theirtravellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of thetypewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his businessaddress asking him if he would come here. As I expected, hisreply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial butcharacteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter fromWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that thedescription tallied in every respect with that of their employé,James Windibank. Voilà tout!""And Miss Sutherland?"
