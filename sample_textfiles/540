go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting forEyford."Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the traintogether, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, InspectorBradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon theseat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyfordfor its centre."There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius often miles from the village. The place we want must be somewherenear that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.""It was an hour's good drive.""And you think that they brought you back all that way when youwere unconscious?""They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of havingbeen lifted and conveyed somewhere.""What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should havespared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties.""I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable facein my life."
