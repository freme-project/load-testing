my place to my younger children.  Alas!  I regret that I am taken from
 you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you
 all?  But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to
 resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting
 you in another world."
