"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, whenwe had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quickand resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?""From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on avery different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I amsorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's businessto a more successful conclusion.""On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could bemore successful. I know that her word is inviolate. Thephotograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.""I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.""I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I canreward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring fromhis finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand."Your Majesty has something which I should value even morehighly," said Holmes."You have but to name it.""This photograph!"The King stared at him in amazement.
