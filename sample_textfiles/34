When I had arrived at this point and had become as wellacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy asdepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, myresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thoughtof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incidenthappened that protracted my stay.One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention wasthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued withlife.  Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as amystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becomingacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain ourinquiries.  I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determinedthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches ofnatural philosophy which relate to physiology.  Unless I had beenanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to thisstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable.  To examine thecauses of life, we must first have recourse to death.  I becameacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; Imust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that mymind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.
