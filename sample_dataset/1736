general (as worthy Mr. Solmes observes) are better governed by fear than
 love.  But this my humour as to servants will not effect either you or
 Miss, you know.
 I will make very advantageous settlements; such as any common friend
 shall judge to be so.  But must have all in my own power, while I live:
 because, you know, Madam, it is as creditable to the wife, as to the
 husband, that it should be so.
 I am not at fine words.  We are not children; though it is hoped we may
 have some; for I am a very healthy sound man.  I bless God for it: and
 never brought home from my voyages and travels a worser constitution than
 I took out with me.  I was none of those, I will assure you.  But this I
 will undertake, that, if you are the survivor, you shall be at the least
 ten thousand pounds the better for me.  What, in the contrary case, I
 shall be the better for you, I leave to you, as you shall think my
 kindness to you shall deserve.
 But one thing, Madam, I shall be glad of, that Miss Howe might not live
 with us then--[she need not know I write thus]--but go home to Mr.
 Hickman, as she is upon the point of marriage, I hear: and if she behaves
 dutifully, as she should do, to us both, she shall be the better; for I
 said so before.
 You shall manage all things, both mine and your own; for I know but
 little of land-matters.  All my opposition to you shall be out of love,
 when I think you take too much upon you for your health.
 It will be very pretty for you, I should think, to have a man of
 experience, in a long winter's evening, to sit down by you, and tell you
 stories of foreign parts, and the customs of the nations he has consorted
 with.  And I have fine curiosities of the Indian growth, such as ladies
 love, and some that even my niece Clary, when she was good, never saw.
 These, one by one, as you are kind to me, (which I make no question of,
 because I shall be kind to you,) shall be all yours.  Prettier
