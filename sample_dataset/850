 But Mr. Solmes is a coarse man. He is not delicate enough for your
 niceness; because I suppose he dresses not like a fop and a coxcomb, and
 because he lays not himself out in complimental nonsense, the poison of
 female minds. He is a man of sense, that I can tell you. No man
 talks more to the purpose to us: but you fly him so, that he has no
 opportunity given him, to express it to you: and a man who loves, if he
 have ever so much sense, looks a fool; especially when he is despised,
 and treated as you treated him the last time he was in your company.
 As to his sister; she threw herself away (as you want to do) against his
 full warning: for he told her what she had to trust to, if she married
 where she did marry. And he was as good as his word; and so an honest

 this be not your case: mind that.
 His uncle deserves no favour from him; for he would have circumvented
 Mr. Solmes, and got Sir Oliver to leave to himself the estate he had
 always designed for him his nephew, and brought him up in the hope of

 father's maxim: and there would not be so many headstrong daughters as
 there are, if this maxim were kept in mind.--Punishments are of service
 to offenders; rewards should be only to the meriting: and I think the
 former are to be dealt out rigourously, in willful cases.
 As to his love; he shews it but too much for your deservings, as they
 have been of late; let me tell you that: and this is his misfortune; and
 may in time perhaps be yours.
 As to his parsimony, which you wickedly call diabolical, [a very free
 word in your mouth, let me tell ye], little reason have you of all
 people for this, on whom he proposes, of his own accord, to settle all
 he has in the world: a proof, let him love riches as he will, that he
 loves you better. But that you may be without excuse on this score,
