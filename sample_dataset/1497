Wicked as the sober world accounts you and me, we have not yet, it is
 to be hoped, got over all compunction. Although we find religion against
 us, we have not yet presumed those who do. And we know better than to
 be even doubters. In short, we believe a future state of rewards and
 punishments. But as we have so much youth and health in hand, we hope to
 have time for repentance. That is to say, in plain English, [nor think
 thou me too grave, Lovelace: thou art grave sometimes, though not
 often,] we hope to live to sense, as long as sense can relish, and
 purpose to reform when we can sin no longer.
 And shall this admirable woman suffer for her generous endeavours to set
 on foot thy reformation; and for insisting upon proofs of the sincerity
 of thy professions before she will be thine?
 Upon the whole matter, let me wish thee to consider well what thou art
 about, before thou goest a step farther in the path which thou hast
 chalked out for thyself to tread, and art just going to enter upon.
 Hitherto all is so far right, that if the lady mistrusts thy honour, she
 has no proofs. Be honest to her, then, in her sense of the word. None of
 thy companions, thou knowest, will offer to laugh at what thou dost.
 And if they should (of thy entering into a state which has been so much
 ridiculed by thee, and by all of us) thou hast one advantage--it is
 this, that thou canst not be ashamed.
 Deferring to the post-day to close my letter, I find one left at my
 cousin Osgood's, with directions to be forwarded to the lady. It
 was brought within these two hours by a particular hand, and has a
 Harlowe-seal upon it. As it may therefore be of importance, I dispatch
 it with my own, by my servant, post-haste.*
      * This letter was from Miss Arabella Harlowe.  See Let. LV.
 I suppose you will soon be in town. Without the lady, I hope. Farewell.
 Be honest, and be happy, J. BELFORD.
