What a cruel thing is suspense!--I will ask leave to go to church this
 afternoon. I expect to be denied. But, if I do not ask, they may allege,
 that my not going is owing to myself.
 I desired to speak with Shorey. Shorey came. I directed her to carry to
 my mother my request for permission to go to church this afternoon. What
 think you was the return? Tell her, that she must direct herself to
 her brother for any favour she has to ask.--So, my dear, I am to be
 delivered up to my brother!
 I was resolved, however, to ask of him this favour. Accordingly, when
 they sent me up my solitary dinner, I gave the messenger a billet,
 in which I made it my humble request through him to my father, to be
 permitted to go to church this afternoon.
 This was the contemptuous answer: 'Tell her, that her request will be
 taken into consideration to-morrow.'
 Patience will be the fittest return I can make to such an insult. But
 this method will not do with me; indeed it will not! And yet it is but
 the beginning, I suppose, of what I am to expect from my brother, now I
 am delivered up to him.
 On recollection, I thought it best to renew my request. I did. The
 following is a copy of what I wrote, and what follows that, of the
 answer sent me.
 SIR,
 I know not what to make of the answer brought to my request of being
 permitted to go to church this afternoon. If you designed to shew your
 pleasantry by it, I hope that will continue; and then my request will be
 granted.
 You know, that I never absented myself, when well, and at home, till the
 two last Sundays; when I was advised not to go. My present situation is
 such, that I never more wanted the benefit of the public prayers.
 I will solemnly engage only to go thither, and back again.
