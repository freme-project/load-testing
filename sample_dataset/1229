Something they pretend to have come at from one of Mr. Lovelace's
 servants, which they hope to make something of. I know not for certain
 what it is. He must be a very vile and wicked man who would boast of a
 lady's favour to him, and reveal secrets. But Mr. Lovelace, I dare say,

 your love by rich presents.--A syncophant man!--I wish he and Betty
 Barnes were to come together; and he would beat her every day.
 After what I told you, I need not advise you to secure every thing you

 Once more let me beg that you will burn this letter; and, pray, dearest

 doubt I must, lest he should take some rash resolutions; especially as
