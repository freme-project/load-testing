they place in the next rank to themselves, their chamber-maids and
 confidants. Your young mistress has contributed a great deal to this
 quickness of yours. She always preferred your company to mine. As
 you pulled, she let go; and so, Mrs. Betty, you have gained by her
 conversation what I have lost.
 Why, Miss, if you come to that, nobody says better things than Miss
 Harlowe. I could tell you one, if I pleased, upon my observing to her,
 that you lived of late upon the air, and had no stomach to any thing;
 yet looked as charmingly as ever.
 I dare say, it was a very good-natured one, Mrs. Betty! Do you then
 please that I shall hear it?
 Only this, Miss, That your stomachfulness had swallowed up your stomach;
 and, That obstinacy was meat, drink, and clothes to you.
 Ay, Mrs. Betty; and did she say this?--I hope she laughed when she said
 it, as she does at all her good things, as she calls them. It was very
 smart, and very witty. I wish my mind were so much at ease, as to aim at
 being witty too. But if you admire such sententious sayings, I'll help
 you to another; and that is, Encouragement and approbation make people
 show talents they were never suspected to have; and this will do both
 for mistress and maid. And another I'll furnish you with, the
 contrary of the former, that will do only for me: That persecution and
 discouragement depress ingenuous minds, and blunt the edge of lively
 imaginations. And hence may my sister's brilliancy and my stupidity be
 both accounted for. Ingenuous, you must know, Mrs. Betty, and ingenious,
 are two things; and I would not arrogate the latter to myself.
 Lord, Miss, said the foolish girl, you know a great deal for your
 years.--You are a very learned young lady!--What pity--
 None of your pitties, Mrs. Betty, I know what you'd say. But tell me, if
 you can, Is it resolved that I shall be carried to my uncle Antony's on
 Thursday?
