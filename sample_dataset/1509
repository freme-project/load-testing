can bear to see them? Yet, how did they use to be shown to every body:
 the former, for the magnifying of your dainty finger-works; the latter,
 for the imputed dignity (dignity now in the dust!) of your boasted
 figure; and this by those fond parents from whom you have run away with
 so much, yet with so little contrivance!
 My brother vows revenge upon your libertine--for the family's sake he
 vows it--not for yours!--for he will treat you, he declares, like a
 common creature, if ever he sees you: and doubts not that this will be
 your fate.
 My uncle Harlowe renounces you for ever.
 So does my uncle Antony.
 So does my aunt Hervey.
 So do I, base, unworthy creature! the disgrace of a good family, and
 the property of an infamous rake, as questionless you will soon find
 yourself, if you are not already.
 Your books, since they have not taught you what belongs to your family,
 to your sex, and to your education, will not be sent to you. Your money
 neither. Nor yet the jewels so undeservedly made yours. For it is wished
 you may be seen a beggar along London-streets.
 If all this is heavy, lay your hand to your heart, and ask yourself, why
 you have deserved it?
 Every man whom your pride taught you to reject with scorn (Mr. Solmes
 excepted, who, however, has reason to rejoice that he missed you)
 triumphs in your shameful elopement, and now knows how to account for
 his being refused.
 Your worthy Norton is ashamed of you, and mingles her tears with your
 mother's; both reproaching themselves for their shares in you, and in so
 fruitless an education.
 Every body, in short, is ashamed of you: but none more than
 ARABELLA HARLOWE.
