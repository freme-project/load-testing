my attention.
 I have been denied breakfasting with her.  Indeed she was a little
 displeased with me last night: because, on our return from the play, I
 obliged her to pass the rest of the night with the women and me, in their
 parlour, and to stay till near one.  She told me at parting, that she

 suspicion of them.  They doubt not my generosity, they say: But why for
 my own sake, in Lord M.'s style, should I make so long a harvest of so
 little corn?
 Women, ye reason well.  I think I will begin my operations the moment she
