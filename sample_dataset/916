I replied, that her pleasantry was much more agreeable than her anger.
 But I wished she would let me know the end of a visit that had hitherto
 (between us) been so unsisterly.
 She desired to be informed, in the name of every body, was her word,
 what I was determined upon? And whether to comply or not?--One word for
 all: My friends were not to have patience with so perverse a creature
 for ever.
 This then I told her I would do: Absolutely break with the man they were
 all so determined against: upon condition, however, that neither Mr.
 Solmes, nor any other, were urged upon me with the force of a command.
 And what was this, more than I had offered before? What, but ringing
 my changes upon the same bells, and neither receding nor advancing one
 tittle?
 If I knew what other proposals I could make, I told her, that would
 be acceptable to them all, and free me from the address of a man so
 disagreeable to me, I would make them. I had indeed before offered,
 never to marry without my father's consent--
 She interrupted me, That was because I depended upon my whining tricks
 to bring my father and mother to what I pleased.
 A poor dependence! I said:--She knew those who would make that
 dependence vain--
 And I should have brought them to my own beck, very probably, and my
 uncle Harlowe too, as also my aunt Hervey, had I not been forbidden from
 their sight, and thereby hindered from playing my pug's tricks before
 them.
 At least, Bella, said I, you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged,
 that my father and mother, and every body else, treat me thus harshly.
 But surely you make them all very weak. Indifferent persons, judging of
 us two from what you say, would either think me a very artful creature,
 or you a very spiteful one--
