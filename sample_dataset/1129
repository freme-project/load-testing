compassion for me?
 You must take no notice of what I tell you, said the dear girl: but my
 mamma has been weeping for you, too, with me; but durst not let any body
 see it: O my Dolly, said my mamma, there never was so set a malice
 in man as in your cousin James Harlowe. They will ruin the flower and
 ornament of their family.
 As how, Miss Dolly?--Did she not explain herself?--As how, my dear?
 Yes; she said, Mr. Solmes would have given up his claim to you; for he
 said, you hated him, and there were no hopes; and your mamma was willing
 he should; and to have you taken at your word, to renounce Mr. Lovelace
 and to live single. My mamma was for it too; for they heard all that
 passed between you and uncle Antony, and cousin James; saying, it was
 impossible to think of prevailing upon you to have Mr. Solmes. Uncle
 Harlowe seemed in the same way of thinking; at least, my mamma says he
 did not say any thing to the contrary. But your papa was immovable, and
 was angry at your mamma and mine upon it.--And hereupon your brother,
 your sister, and my uncle Antony, joined in, and changed the scene
 entirely. In short, she says, that Mr. Solmes had great matters engaged
 to him. He owned, that you were the finest young lady in England, and
 he would be content to be but little beloved, if he could not, after
 marriage, engage your heart, for the sake of having the honour to call
 you his but for one twelvemonth--I suppose he would break your heart the
 next--for he is a cruel-hearted man, I am sure.
 My friends may break my heart, cousin Dolly; but Mr. Solmes will never
 have it in his power to break it.
 I do not know that, Miss: you will have good luck to avoid having him,
 by what I can find; for my mamma says, they are all now of one mind,
 herself excepted; and she is forced to be silent, your papa and brother
 are both so outrageous.
 I am got above minding my brother, cousin Dolly:--he is but my brother.
