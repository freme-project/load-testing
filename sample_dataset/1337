answered, that thou hast yet to account to me for thy reluctance to go
 off with me, at a crisis when thy going off was necessary to avoid being
 forced into the nuptial fetters with a wretch, that, were he not thy
 aversion, thou wert no more honest to thy own merit than to me.
 I am accustomed to be preferred, let me tell thee, by thy equals in rank
 too, though thy inferiors in merit: But who is not so? And shall I marry
 a woman, who has given me reason to doubt the preference she has for me?
 No, my dearest love, I have too sacred a regard for thy injunctions, to
 let them be broken through, even by thyself. Nor will I take in thy full
 meaning by blushing silence only. Nor shalt thou give me room to doubt,
 whether it be necessity or love, that inspires this condescending
 impulse.
 Upon these principles, what had I to do but to construe her silence into
 contemptuous displeasure? And I begged her pardon for making a motion
 which I had so much reason to fear would offend her: for the future I
 would pay a sacred regard to her previous injunctions, and prove to
 her by all my conduct the truth of that observation, That true love is
 always fearful of offending.
 And what could the lady say to this? methinks thou askest.
 Say!--Why she looked vexed, disconcerted, teased; was at a loss, as I
 thought, whether to be more angry with herself, or with me. She turned
 about, however, as if to hide a starting tear; and drew a sigh into
 two or three but just audible quavers, trying to suppress it, and
 withdrew--leaving me master of the field.
 Tell me not of politeness; tell me not of generosity; tell me not of
 compassion--Is she not a match for me? More than a match? Does she not
 outdo me at every fair weapon? Has she not made me doubt her love? Has
 she not taken officious pains to declare that she was not averse to
 Solmes for any respect she had to me? and her sorrow for putting herself
 out of his reach, that is to say, for meeting me?
