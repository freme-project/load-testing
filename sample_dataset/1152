to like contempts. Upon the whole, Madam, said I, can you say, that the
 inveteracy lies not as much on our side, as on his? Can he say any thing
 of us more disrespectful than we say of him?--And as to the suggestion,
 so often repeated, that he will make a bad husband, Is it possible for
 him to use a wife worse than I am used; particularly by my brother and
 sister?
 Ah, Niece! Ah, my dear! how firmly has this wicked man attached you!
 Perhaps not, Madam. But really great care should be taken by fathers and
 mothers, when they would have their daughters of their minds in these
 particulars, not to say things that shall necessitate the child, in
 honour and generosity, to take part with the man her friends are averse
 to. But, waving all this, as I have offered to renounce him for ever, I
 see now why he should be mentioned to me, nor why I should be wished to
 hear any thing about him.
 Well, but still, my dear, there can be no harm to let Mr. Solmes tell
 you what Mr. Lovelace has said of you. Severely as you have treated Mr.
 Solmes, he is fond of attending you once more: he begs to be heard on
 this head.
 If it be proper for me to hear it, Madam--
 It is, eagerly interrupted she, very proper.
 Has what he has said of me, Madam, convinced you of Mr. Lovelace's
 baseness?
 It has, my dear: and that you ought to abhor him for it.
 Then, dear Madam, be pleased to let me hear it from your mouth: there
 is no need that I should see Mr. Solmes, when it will have double the
 weight from you. What, Madam, has the man dared to say of me?
 My aunt was quite at a loss.
 At last, Well, said she, I see how you are attached. I am sorry for it,
 Miss. For I do assure you, it will signify nothing. You must be Mrs.
 Solmes; and that in a very few days.
