troubles not his head with politics, though nobody knows the interests
 of princes and courts better than he is said to do.'
 That you and I, my dear, should love to write, is no wonder. We have
 always, from the time each could hold a pen, delighted in epistolary
 correspondencies. Our employments are domestic and sedentary; and we can
 scribble upon twenty innocent subjects, and take delight in them because
 they are innocent; though were they to be seen, they might not much
 profit or please others. But that such a gay, lively young fellow as
 this, who rides, hunts, travels, frequents the public entertainments,
 and has means to pursue his pleasures, should be able to set himself
 down to write for hours together, as you and I have heard him say he
 frequently does, that is the strange thing.
 Mrs. Fortescue says, 'that he is a complete master of short-hand
 writing.' By the way, what inducements could a swift writer as he have
 to learn short-hand!
 She says (and we know it as well as she) 'that he has a surprising
 memory, and a very lively imagination.'
 Whatever his other vices are, all the world, as well as Mrs. Fortescue,
 says, 'he is a sober man. And among all his bad qualities, gaming, that
 great waster of time as well as fortune, is not his vice:' So that he
 must have his head as cool, and his reason as clear, as the prime of
 youth and his natural gaiety will permit; and by his early morning
 hours, a great portion of time upon his hands to employ in writing, or
 worse.
 Mrs. Fortescue says, 'he has one gentleman who is more his intimate and
 correspondent than any of the rest.' You remember what his dismissed
 bailiff said of him and of his associates.* I don't find but that Mrs.
 Fortescue confirms this part of it, 'that all his relations are afraid
 of him; and that his pride sets him above owing obligations to them.
 She believes he is clear of the world; and that he will continue so;'
