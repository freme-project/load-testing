You seem angry, Miss. I hope I take no unbecoming liberty.
 If thou really thinkest thou dost not, thy ignorance is more to be
 pitied, than thy pertness resented. I wish thou wouldst leave me to

 When young ladies fall out with their own duty, it is not much to be
 wondered at, that they are angry at any body who do theirs.
 That's a very pretty saying, Mrs. Betty!--I see plainly what thy duty is
