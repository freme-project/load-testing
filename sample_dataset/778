She had hardly spoken the words, when Shorey came in to tell her, that
 Mr. Solmes was in the hall, and desired admittance.
 Ugly creature! What, at the close of day, quite dark, brought him
 hither?--But, on second thoughts, I believe it was contrived, that he
 should be here at supper, to know the result of the conference between
 my mother and me, and that my father, on his return, might find us
 together.
 I was hurrying away, but my mother commanded me (since I had come down
 only, as she said, to mock her) not to stir; and at the same time see
 if I could behave so to Mr. Solmes, as might encourage her to make the
 favourable report to my father which I had besought her to make.
 My sister triumphed. I was vexed to be so caught, and to have such an
 angry and cutting rebuke given me, with an aspect much more like the
 taunting sister than the indulgent mother, if I may presume to say so:
 for she herself seemed to enjoy the surprise upon me.
 The man stalked in. His usual walk is by pauses, as if (from the same
 vacuity of thought which made Dryden's clown whistle) he was telling
 his steps: and first paid his clumsy respects to my mother; then to my
 sister; next to me, as if I was already his wife, and therefore to be
 last in his notice; and sitting down by me, told us in general what
 weather it was. Very cold he made it; but I was warm enough. Then
 addressing himself to me: And how do you find it, Miss? was his
 question; and would have taken my hand.
 I withdrew it, I believe with disdain enough. My mother frowned. My
 sister bit her lip.
 I could not contain myself: I was never so bold in my life; for I went
 on with my plea, as if Mr. Solmes had not been there.
 My mother coloured, and looked at him, at my sister, and at me. My
 sister's eyes were opener and bigger than ever I saw them before.
 The man understood me. He hemmed, and removed from one chair to another.
