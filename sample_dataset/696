happen, since matters are in such a train; and since you have not the
 courage to oppose so overwhelming a torrent?
 You ask me to help you to a little of my spirit. Are you in earnest?
 But it will not now, I doubt, do you service.--It will not sit naturally
 upon you. You are your mother's girl, think what you will; and have
 violent spirits to contend with. Alas! my dear, you should have borrowed
 some of mine a little sooner;--that is to say, before you had given the
 management of your estate into the hands of those who think they have a
 prior claim to it. What though a father's!--Has not the father two elder
 children?--And do they not both bear more of his stamp and image than
 you do?--Pray, my dear, call me not to account for this free question;
 lest your application of my meaning, on examination, prove to be as
 severe as that.
 Now I have launched out a little, indulge me one word more in the same
 strain--I will be decent, I promise you. I think you might have know,
 that Avarice and Envy are two passions that are not to be satisfied, the
 one by giving, the other by the envied person's continuing to deserve
 and excel.--Fuel, fuel both, all the world over, to flames insatiate and
 devouring.
 But since you ask for my opinion, you must tell me all you know or
 surmise of their inducements. And if you will not forbid me to make
 extracts from your letters for the entertainment of my aunt and cousin
 in the little island, who long to hear more of your affairs, it will be
 very obliging.
 But you are so tender of some people who have no tenderness for any body
 but themselves, that I must conjure you to speak out. Remember, that
 a friendship like ours admits of no reserves. You may trust my
 impartiality. It would be an affront to your own judgment, if you did
 not: For do you not ask my advice? And have you not taught me that
 friendship should never give a bias against justice?--Justify them,
