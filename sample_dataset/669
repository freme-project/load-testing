to bring forward some desperate issue between the two; since the offence
 so readily given on one side was brooked by the other only out of
 consideration to me.
 And thus did my brother's rashness lay me under an obligation where I
 would least have owed it.
 The intermediate proposals of Mr. Symmes and Mr. Mullins, both (in turn)
 encouraged by my brother, induced him to be more patient for a while,
 as nobody thought me over-forward in Mr. Lovelace's favour; for he hoped

 Lovelace swear that he would not depart till he had made my uncles ask
