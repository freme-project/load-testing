 It is now in vain to wish it had come sooner.  But if it had, I might
 perhaps have been so rash as to give Mr. Lovelace the fatal meeting, as I
 little thought of going away with him.
 But I should hardly have given him the expectation of so doing, previous
 to the meeting, which made him come prepared; and the revocation of which
 he so artfully made ineffectual.
 Persecuted as I was, and little expecting so much condescension, as my
