punishment more than enough for your involuntary fault in that husband.
 I would not have you be too sure that their project to seize you is
 over. The words intimating that it is over, in the letter of that
 abominable Arabella, seem calculated to give you security.--She only
 says she believes that design is over.--And I do not yet find from Miss
 Lloyd that it is disavowed. So it will be best, when you are in London,
 to be private, and, for fear of the worst, to let every direction to be
 a third place; for I would not, for the world, have you fall into the
 hands of such flaming and malevolent spirits by surprize.
 I will myself be content to direct you at some third place; and I shall
 then be able to aver to my mother, or to any other, if occasion be, that
 I know not where you are.
 Besides, this measure will make you less apprehensive of the
 consequences of their violence, should they resolve to attempt to carry
 you of in spite of Lovelace.
 I would have you direct to Mr. Hickman, even your answer to this. I have
 a reason for it. Besides, my mother, notwithstanding this particular
 indulgence, is very positive. They have prevailed upon her, I know, to
 give her word to this purpose--Spiteful, poor wretches! How I hate in
 particular your foolish uncle Antony.
 I would not have your thought dwell on the contents of your sister's
 shocking letter; but pursue other subjects--the subjects before you.
 And let me know your progress with Lovelace, and what he says to this
 diabolical curse. So far you may enter into this hateful subject. I
 expect that this will aptly introduce the grant topic between you,
 without needing a mediator.
 Come, my dear, when things are at worst they will mend. Good often comes
 when evil is expected.--But if you despond, there can be no hopes of
 cure. Don't let them break your heart; for that is plain to me, is now
 what some people have in view for you to do.
