to without it); lest any evil should follow it: in which case, I
 should never forgive myself. And this consideration has added to my
 difficulties in writing to you now you are upon such a crisis, and yet
 refuse the only method--but I said, I would not for the present touch
 any more that string. Yet, one word more, chide me if you please: If any
 harm betide you, I shall for ever blame my mother--indeed I shall--and
 perhaps yourself, if you do not accept my offer.
 But one thing, in your present situation and prospects, let me advise:
 It is this, that if you do go off with Mr. Lovelace, you take the first

 go whithersoever you will?--You may indeed keep him at a distance, until
 settlements are drawn, and such like matters are adjusted to your mind:
 but even these are matters of less consideration in your particular

 his other faults what they will, nobody thinks him an ungenerous man:
 next, because the possession of your estate must be given up to you
 as soon as your cousin Morden comes; who, as your trustee, will see
 it done; and done upon proper terms: 3dly, because there is no want of
 fortune on his side: 4thly, because all his family value you, and are
 extremely desirous that you should be their relation: 5thly, because he
 makes no scruple of accepting you without conditions. You see how he has
 always defied your relations: [I, for my own part, can forgive him for
 the fault: nor know I, if it be not a noble one:] and I dare say, he
 had rather call you his, without a shilling, than be under obligation
 to those whom he has full as little reason to love, as they have to love
 him. You have heard, that his own relations cannot make his proud spirit
 submit to owe any favour to them.
 For all these reasons, I think, you may the less stand upon previous
 settlements. It is therefore my absolute opinion, that, if you do
