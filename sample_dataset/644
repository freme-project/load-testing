however, of intentional pride, scorn, haughtiness, or want of
 sensibility. What a triumph over the sex, and over her whole family, if
 he can carry off a lady so watchful and so prudent! Is resolved, if he
 cannot have the sister, to carry off the brother. Libertine as he is,
 can have no thoughts of any other woman but Clarissa. Warns Belford,
