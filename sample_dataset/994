     Wisdom's thy gift, and all her force
      From thee deriv'd, Eternal source
         Of Intellectual Light!
      O send her sure, her steady ray,
      To regulate my doubtful way,
         Thro' life's perplexing road:
      The mists of error to controul,
      And thro' its gloom direct my soul
         To happiness and good.
      XVI.
      Beneath her clear discerning eye
      The visionary shadows fly
         Of Folly's painted show.
      She sees thro' ev'ry fair disguise,
      That all but Virtue's solid joys,
         Is vanity and woe.
 [Facsimile of the music to "The Ode to Wisdom" (verse 14).]
 LETTER XI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY MIDNIGHT.
 I have now a calmer moment. Envy, ambition, high and selfish resentment,
 and all the violent passions, are now, most probably, asleep all around
 me; and shall now my own angry ones give way to the silent hour, and
 subside likewise?--They have given way to it; and I have made use of
 the gentler space to re-peruse your last letters. I will touch upon
 some passages in them. And that I may the less endanger the but-just
 recovered calm, I will begin with what you write about Mr. Hickman.
 Give me leave to say, That I am sorry you cannot yet persuade yourself
 to think better, that is to say, more justly, of that gentleman, than
 your whimsical picture of him shews you so; or, at least, than the
 humourousness of your natural vein would make one think you do.
