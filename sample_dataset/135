not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess.  If any being felt
 emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and
 a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the
 whole kind!  But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be
 realized.  What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a
 creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is
 small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.  It
 is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that
 account we shall be more attached to one another.  Our lives will not
 be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now
 feel.  Oh!  My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards
 you for one benefit!  Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some
 existing thing; do not deny me my request!"
 I was moved.  I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
 of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.
 His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature
 of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion
 of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?  He saw my change of
 feeling and continued,
 "If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
 us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.  My food is not
 that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
 acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.  My companion will
 be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
 We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
 man and will ripen our food.  The picture I present to you is peaceful
 and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
 wantonness of power and cruelty.  Pitiless as you have been towards me,
 I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
 and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire."
