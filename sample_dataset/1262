 a hand in this matter, out of my great regard to you.
 When you have opened the door, take your key out of the lock, and put
 it in your pocket: then, stooping for mine, put it in the lock on the

 a key, which they will suppose to be of my procuring (it being new) and

 honest Joseph; and she'll not know it to be you. Men's airs and gaits
