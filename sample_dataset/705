least) over a person whose heart he thinks he has engaged. And, thirdly,
 because the assiduities and veneration which you impute to him, seem to
 carry an haughtiness in them, as if he thought his address had a merit
 in it, that would be more than an equivalent to a woman's love. In
 short, his very politeness, notwithstanding the advantages he must have
 had from his birth and education, appear to be constrained; and, with
 the most remarkable easy and genteel person, something, at times,
 seems to be behind in his manner that is too studiously kept in. Then,
 good-humoured as he is thought to be in the main to other people's
 servants, and this even to familiarity (although, as you have observed,
 a familiarity that has dignity in it not unbecoming to a man of quality)
 he is apt sometimes to break out into a passion with his own: An oath
 or a curse follows, and such looks from those servants as plainly shew
 terror, and that they should have fared worse had they not been in my
 hearing: with a confirmation in the master's looks of a surmise too well
 justified.

 Indeed, my dear, THIS man is not THE man. I have great objections to
 him. My heart throbs not after him. I glow not, but with indignation
 against myself for having given room for such an imputation. But you
 must not, my dearest friend, construe common gratitude into love. I
 cannot bear that you should. But if ever I should have the misfortune to
 think it love, I promise you upon my word, which is the same as upon my
 honour, that I will acquaint you with it.
 You bid me to tell you very speedily, and by the new-found expedient,
 that I am not displeased with you for your agreeable raillery: I
 dispatch this therefore immediately, postponing to my next the account
 of the inducements which my friends have to promote with so much
 earnestness the address of Mr. Solmes.
 Be satisfied, my dear, mean time, that I am not displeased with you:
