opportunity, in the last resort, to withdraw. Mrs. Norton is to be with
 me: she, although she should be chidden for it, will, in my extremity,
 plead for me. My aunt Hervey may, in such an extremity, join with her.
 Perhaps my mother may be brought over. I will kneel to each, one by one,
 to make a friend. Some of them have been afraid to see me, lest they
 should be moved in my favour: does not this give a reasonable hope that
 I may move them? My brother's counsel, heretofore given, to turn me out
 of doors to my evil destiny, may again be repeated, and may prevail;
 then shall I be in no worse case than now, as to the displeasure of my
 friends; and thus far better, that it will not be my fault that I seek
 another protection: which even then ought to be my cousin Morden's,
 rather than Mr. Lovelace's, or any other person's.
 My heart, in short, misgives me less, when I resolve this way, than when
 I think of the other: and in so strong and involuntary a bias, the heart
 is, as I may say, conscience. And well cautions the wise man: 'Let the
 counsel of thine own heart stand; for there is no man more faithful to
 thee than it: for a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell him more than
 seven watchmen, that sit above in a high tower.'*

 Forgive these indigested self-reasonings. I will close here: and
 instantly set about a letter of revocation to Mr. Lovelace; take it
 as he will. It will only be another trial of temper to him. To me of
 infinite importance. And has he not promised temper and acquiescence, on
 the supposition of a change in my mind?
 LETTER XLVI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.
 Nobody it seems will go to church this day. No blessing to be expected
 perhaps upon views so worldly, and in some so cruel.
 They have a mistrust that I have some device in my head. Betty has been
 looking among my clothes. I found her, on coming up from depositing my
