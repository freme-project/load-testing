influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway
 over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's
 door--led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.  He
 was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
 asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different
 branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.  I replied
 carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my
 alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.  The professor
 stared.  "Have you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such
 nonsense?"
 I replied in the affirmative.  "Every minute," continued M. Krempe with
 warmth, "every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly

 and useless names.  Good God!  In what desert land have you lived,
 where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
 have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
 are ancient?  I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
 age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.  My dear
 sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."
 So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
 treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
 dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
 week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
 philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow
 professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
 omitted.
 I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
 considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
 returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
 shape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
