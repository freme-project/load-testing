express myself! if thou canst raise a weakness in her by love, or by arts

 them shall regularly attend you for any letter or commands. It will be
 charity to write to me as often as you can.  For although I am likely to
 be a considerable gainer by the poor man's death, yet I cannot say that I
 at all love these scenes of death and the doctor so near me.  The doctor
 and death I should have said; for that is the natural order, and
 generally speaking, the one is but the harbinger to the other.
 If, therefore, you decline to oblige me, I shall think you are displeased
 with my freedom.  But let me tell you, at the same, that no man has a
 right to be displeased at freedoms taken with him for faults he is not
 ashamed to be guilty of.
 J. BELFORD.

 always out of humour with him: that I could not have behaved more
