unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the
 silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his
 companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
 of the way of danger.
 "Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
 once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I
 have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what
 have I gained?"
 "Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of
 value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the
 reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
 existence."
 X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
 The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
 long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
 in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
 eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
 gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
 believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
 the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
 considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
 memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
 this remarkable episode.
 It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
 was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
 home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
 waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
 had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
 the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
 a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
