generosity to treat you the better for disclaiming the power they know
 you have. That, I think, need not now be told you. I am, my dearest
 friend, and ever will be,
 Your most affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER VI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDN. NIGHT, MARCH 22.
 On the report made by my aunt and sister of my obstinacy, my assembled
 relations have taken an unanimous resolution (as Betty tells me it
 is) against me. This resolution you will find signified to me in the
 inclosed letter from my brother, just now brought me. Be pleased to
 return it, when perused. I may have occasion for it, in the altercations
 between my relations and me.

 MISS CLARY,
 I am commanded to let you know, that my father and uncles having heard
 your aunt Hervey's account of all that has passed between her and you:
 having heard from your sister what sort of treatment she has had from
 you: having recollected all that has passed between your mother and
 you: having weighed all your pleas and proposals: having taken into
 consideration their engagements with Mr. Solmes; that gentleman's
 patience, and great affection for you; and the little opportunity you
 have given yourself to be acquainted either with his merit, or his
 proposals: having considered two points more; to wit, the wounded
 authority of a father; and Mr. Solmes's continued entreaties (little
 as you have deserved regard from him) that you may be freed from a
 confinement to which he is desirous to attribute your perverseness to
 him [averseness I should have said, but let it go], he being unable to
 account otherwise for so strong a one, supposing you told truth to your
 mother, when you asserted that your heart was free; and which Mr. Solmes
 is willing to believe, though nobody else does--For all these reasons,
