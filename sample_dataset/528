when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it
 here and I will read it to you:
                        "'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
 "'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
 address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
 reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you
 should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of
 you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a
 year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
 our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My
 wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would
 like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need
 not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one
 belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which
 would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting
 here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that
 need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no
 doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty
 during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain
 firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary
 may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child
 is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall
 meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.
 Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
 "That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and
 my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,
 that before taking the final step I should like to submit the
 whole matter to your consideration."
 "Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
 question," said Holmes, smiling.
