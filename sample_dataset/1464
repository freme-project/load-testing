that other grew insolent, as soon as his insulter was gone, and was
 continually pecking at one or two under him. Peck and be hanged, said
 I,--I might as well have preserved the first, for I see it is the nature
 of the beast.
 Excuse my flippancies. I wish I were with you. I would make you smile in
 the midst of your gravest airs, as I used to do. O that you had
 accepted of my offer to attend you! but nothing that I offer will you
 accept----Take care!--You will make me very angry with you: and when I
 am, you know I value nobody: for, dearly as I love you, I must be, and
 cannot always help it,
 Your saucy ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER XLV
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY, APRIL 22.
 Mr. Lovelace communicated to me this morning early, from his
 intelligencer, the news of my brother's scheme. I like him the better
 for making very light of it, and for his treating it with contempt. And
 indeed, had I not had the hint of it from you, I should have suspected
 it to be some contrivance of his, in order to hasten me to town, where
 he has long wished to be himself.
 He read me the passage in that Leman's letter, which is pretty much to
 the effect of what you wrote to me from Miss Lloyd; with this addition,
 that one Singleton, a master of a Scots vessel, is the man who is to be
 the principal in this act of violence.
 I have seen him. He had been twice entertained at Harlowe-place, as my
 brother's friend. He has the air of a very bold and fearless man, and I
 fancy it must be his project; as my brother, I suppose, talks to every
 body of the rash step I have taken, for he did not spare me before he
 had this seeming reason to censure me.
 This Singleton lives at Leith; so, perhaps, I am to be carried to my
 brother's house not far from that port.
