must touch upon.
 You again insist (strengthened by Mr. Lovelace's opinion) upon my
 assuming my own estate [I cannot call it resuming, having never been
 in possession of it]: and I have given you room to expect, that I will
 consider this subject more closely than I have done before. I must
 however own, that the reasons which I had to offer against taking
 your advice were so obvious, that I thought you would have seen
 them yourself, and been determined by them, against your own hastier
 counsel.--But since this has not been so, and that both you and Mr.
 Lovelace call upon me to assume my own estate, I will enter briefly into

 late, so affectionate?==But were such a protector to be found, what a
 length of time would it take up in a course of litigation! The will and
 the deeds have flaws in them, they say. My brother sometimes talks
