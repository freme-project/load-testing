 LETTER XVI
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
 WEDNESDAY, MAY 3.
 When I have already taken pains to acquaint thee in full with regard to
 my views, designs, and resolutions, with regard to this admirable woman,
 it is very extraordinary that thou shouldst vapour as thou dost in her
 behalf, when I have made no trial, no attempt: and yet, givest it as thy
 opinion in a former letter, that advantage may be taken of the situation
 she is in; and that she may be overcome.
 Most of thy reflections, particularly that which respects the difference
 as to the joys to be given by the virtuous and libertine of her sex, are
 fitter to come in as after-reflections than as antecedencies.
 I own with thee, and with the poet, that sweet are the joys that come
 with willingness--But is it to be expected, that a woman of education,
 and a lover of forms, will yield before she is attacked?  And have I so
 much as summoned this to surrender?  I doubt not but I shall meet with
 difficulty.  I must therefore make my first effort by surprise.  There
 may possibly be some cruelty necessary: but there may be consent in
 struggle; there may be yielding in resistance.  But the first conflict
 over, whether the following may not be weaker and weaker, till
 willingness ensue, is the point to be tried.  I will illustrate what I
 have said by the simile of a bird new caught.  We begin, when boys, with
 birds; and when grown up, go on to women; and both perhaps, in turn,
 experience our sportive cruelty.
