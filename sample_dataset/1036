I must take that chance, said I: I only desire that you will deliver it
 as directed.
 Sad doings! very sad! she said, that young ladies should so violently
 set themselves against their duty.
 I told her, she should have the liberty to say what she pleased, so she
 would but be my messenger that one time: and down she went with it.
 I bid her, if she could, slide it into my uncle's hand, unseen; at least
 unseen by my brother or sister, for fear it should meet, through their
 good office, with the fate she had bespoken for it.
 She would not undertake for that, she said.
 I am now in expectation of the result. But having so little ground to
 hope for their favour or mercy, I opened Mr. Lovelace's letter.
 I would send it to you, my dear (as well as those I shall enclose) by
 this conveyance; but not being able at present to determine in what
 manner I shall answer it, I will give myself the trouble of abstracting
 it here, while I am waiting for what may offer from the letter just
 carried down.
 'He laments, as usual, my ill opinion of him, and readiness to believe
 every thing to his disadvantage. He puts into plain English, as I
 supposed he would, my hint, that I might be happier, if, by any rashness
 he might be guilty of to Solmes, he should come to an untimely end
 himself.'
 He is concerned, he says, 'That the violence he had expressed on his
 extreme apprehensiveness of losing me, should have made him guilty of
 any thing I had so much reason to resent.'
 He owns, 'That he is passionate: all good-natured men, he says, are so;
 and a sincere man cannot hide it.' But appeals to me, 'Whether, if any
 occasion in the world could excuse the rashness of his expressions, it
 would not be his present dreadful situation, through my indifference,
 and the malice of his enemies.'
