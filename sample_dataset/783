CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 5.
 Hannah has just brought me from the private place in the garden-wall, a
 letter from Mr. Lovelace, deposited last night, signed also by Lord M.
 He tells me in it, 'That Mr. Solmes makes it his boast, that he is to
 be married in a few days to one of the shyest women in England: that my
 brother explains his meaning: This shy creature, he says, is me; and
 he assures every one, that his younger sister is very soon to be Mr.
 Solmes's wife. He tells me of the patterns bespoken which my mother
 mentioned to me.'
 Not one thing escapes him that is done or said in this house.
 'My sister, he says, reports the same things; and that with such
 particular aggravations of insult upon him, that he cannot but be
 extremely piqued, as well at the manner, as from the occasion; and
 expresses himself with great violence upon it.
 'He knows not, he says, what my relations' inducements can be to prefer
 such a man as Solmes to him. If advantageous settlements be the motive,
 Solmes shall not offer what he will refuse to comply with.
 'As to his estate and family; the first cannot be excepted against: and
 for the second, he will not disgrace himself by a comparison so odious.
 He appeals to Lord M. for the regularity of his life and manners ever
 since he has made his addresses to me, or had hope of my favour.'
 I suppose he would have his Lordship's signing to this letter to be
 taken as a voucher for him.
 'He desires my leave (in company with my Lord), in a pacific manner,
 to attend my father and uncles, in order to make proposals that must be
 accepted, if they will see him, and hear what they are: and tells me,
 that he will submit to any measures that I shall prescribe, in order to
 bring about a reconciliation.'
