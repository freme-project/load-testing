distemper I have named; which seized him all at once in the very prime
 of life, in so violent a manner as to take from the most active of
 minds, as his was, all power of activity, and that in all appearance for
 life.--It imprisoned, as I may say, his lively spirits in himself,
 and turned the edge of them against his own peace; his extraordinary
 prosperity adding to his impatiency. Those, I believe, who want the
 fewest earthly blessings, most regret that they want any.
 But my brother! What excuse can be made for his haughty and morose
 temper? He is really, my dear, I am sorry to have occasion to say it, an
 ill-temper'd young man; and treats my mother sometimes--Indeed he is not
 dutiful.--But, possessing every thing, he has the vice of age, mingled
 with the ambition of youth, and enjoys nothing--but his own haughtiness
 and ill-temper, I was going to say.--Yet again am I adding force to your
 dislikes of some of us.--Once, my dear, it was perhaps in your power to
 have moulded him as you pleased.--Could you have been my sister!--Then
 had I friend in a sister.--But no wonder that he does not love you now;
 who could nip in the bud, and that with a disdain, let me say, too
 much of kin to his haughtiness, a passion that would not have wanted
 a fervour worthy of the object; and which possibly would have made him
 worthy.
 But no more of this. I will prosecute my former intention in my next;
 which I will sit down to as soon as breakfast is over; dispatching this
 by the messenger whom you have so kindly sent to inquire after us on my
 silence. Mean time, I am,
 Your most affectionate and obliged friend and servant, CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER VI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE HARLOWE-PLACE, JAN. 20.
 I will now resume my narrative of proceedings here.--My brother being
 in a good way, although you may be sure that his resentments are rather
 heightened than abated by the galling disgrace he has received, my
