You will say that I am very grave: and so I am.  Mr. Lovelace is
 extremely sunk in my opinion since Monday night: nor see I before me any
 thing that can afford me a pleasing hope.  For what, with a mind so

 on the brink of the other.
 You will the less wonder at my being so very solemn, when, added to the
 above, and to my uncertain situation, I tell you, that they have sent me

 I am extremely concerned to hear of a difference betwixt the rest of a
 family so near and dear to me, and you still dearer to than any of the
 rest.
 My cousin James has acquainted me with the offers you have had, and with
 your refusals.  I wonder not at either.  Such charming promises at so
 early an age as when I left England; and those promises, as I have often
 heard, so greatly exceeded, as well in your person as mind; how much must
 you be admired! how few must there be worthy of you!
 Your parents, the most indulgent in the world, to a child the most
 deserving, have given way it seems to your refusal of several gentlemen.
 They have contented themselves at last to name one with earnestness to
