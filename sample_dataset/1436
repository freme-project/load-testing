the London widow and her nieces, who, according to his friend's account,
 lived so genteelly; and especially as I required him to leave me so soon
 after I arrived there, and so would be left alone among strangers. He
 therefore sought that I might engage Mrs. Sorlings to lend me one of her
 two maids, or let one of her daughters go up with me, and stay till I
 were provided. And if the latter, the young gentlewoman, no doubt, would
 be glad of so good an opportunity to see the curiosities of the town,
 and would be a proper attendant on the same occasions.
 I told him as I had done before, that the two young gentlewomen were so
 equally useful in their way, and servants in a busy farm were so little
 to be spared, that I should be loth to take them off their laudable
 employments. Nor should I think much of diversions for one while; and so
 the less want an attendant out of doors.
 And now, my dear, lest any thing should happen, in so variable a
 situation as mine, (which at present are more promising than ever yet
 they have been since I quitted Harlowe-place,) I will snatch the
 opportunity to subscribe myself
 Your not unhoping and ever-obliged friend and servant, CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXXIX

      He begins with communicating to him the letter he wrote to
      Mr. Doleman, to procure suitable lodgings in town, and which
      he sent away by the Lady's approbation: and then gives him a
      copy of the answer to it (see p. 218): upon which he thus
      expresses himself:
 Thou knowest the widow; thou knowest her nieces; thou knowest the
 lodgings: and didst thou ever read a letter more artfully couched
 than this of Tom Doleman? Every possible objection anticipated! Every
 accident provided against! Every tittle of it plot-proof!
 Who could forbear smiling, to see my charmer, like a farcical dean and
