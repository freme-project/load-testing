whether you ought to be angry at Lovelace. Yet I have wished fifty
 times, since Lovelace got you away, that you were rid of him, whether it
 were by a burning fever, by hanging, by drowning, or by a broken

 really had for her.
 Believe me ever, what you, my dear, shall ever find me,
 Your faithful and affectionate, ANNA HOWE.

 from my sad circumstances to think the best of him. If his pretences
