generous design of those praises raises and comforts it: for it is a
 charming thing to stand high in the opinion of those we love; and to find
 that there are souls that can carry their friendships beyond accidents,
 beyond body and ties of blood.  Whatever, my dearest creature, is my
 shining-time, the time of a friend's adversity is yours.  And it would be
 almost a fault in me to regret those afflictions, which give you an
 opportunity so gloriously to exert those qualities, which not only
 ennoble our sex, but dignify human nature.
 But let me proceed to subjects less agreeable.
 I am sorry you have reason to think Singleton's projects are not at an
 end.  But who knows what the sailor had to propose?--Yet had any good
 been intended me, this method would hardly have been fallen upon.
 Depend upon it, my dear, your letters shall be safe.
 I have made a handle of Mr. Lovelace's bold attempt and freedom, as I
 told you I would, to keep him ever since at a distance, that I may have
 an opportunity to see the success of the application to my uncle, and to
 be at liberty to embrace any favourable overtures that may arise from it.
 Yet he has been very importunate, and twice brought Mr. Mennell from Mrs.
 Fretchvill to talk about the house.--If I should be obliged to make up
 with him again, I shall think I am always doing myself a spite.
 As to what you mention of his newly-detected crimes; and your advice to
 attach Dorcas to my interest; and to come at some of his letters; these
 things will require more or less of my attention, as I may hope favour or
 not from my uncle Harlowe.
 I am sorry that my poor Hannah continues ill.  Pray, my dear, inform
 yourself, and let me know, whether she wants any thing that befits her
 case.
 I will not close this letter till to-morrow is over; for I am resolved to
 go to church; and this as well for the sake of my duty, as to see if I am
 at liberty to go out when I please without being attended or accompanied.
