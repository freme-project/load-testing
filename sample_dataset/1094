contrivances and expedients for my escaping my threatened compulsion.'
 I have always said, that next to being without fault, is the
 acknowledgement of a fault; since no amendment can be expected where an
 error is defended: but you will see in this very letter, an haughtiness
 even in his submissions. 'Tis true, I know not where to find fault as
 to the expression; yet cannot I be satisfied, that his humility is
 humility; or even an humility upon such conviction as one should be
 pleased with.
 To be sure, he is far from being a polite man: yet is not directly and
