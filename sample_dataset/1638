should always remember this saving clause, that they may not be forsworn.
 But thinkest thou that I will not make it the subject of one of my first
 plots to inform myself of the reason why all this commotion was necessary
 on so slight an occasion as this would have been, were not the letters that
 pass between these ladies of a treasonable nature?
 WEDNESDAY MORNING.
 No admission to breakfast, any more than to supper.  I wish this lady is
 not a simpleton, after all.
 I have sent up in Captain Mennell's name.
 A message from Captain Mennell, Madam.
 It won't do.  She is of baby age.  She cannot be--a Solomon, I was going
 to say, in every thing.  Solomon, Jack, was the wisest man.  But didst
 ever hear who was the wisest woman?  I want a comparison for this lady.
 Cunning women and witches we read of without number.  But I fancy wisdom
 never entered into the character of a woman.  It is not a requisite of
 the sex.  Women, indeed, make better sovereigns than men: but why is
 that?--because the women-sovereigns are governed by men; the men-
 sovereigns by women.--Charming, by my soul!  For hence we guess at the
 rudder by which both are steered.
 But to putting wisdom out of the question, and to take cunning in; that
 is to say, to consider woman as a woman; what shall we do, if this lady
 has something extraordinary in her head?  Repeated charges has she given
 to Wilson, by a particular messenger, to send any letter directed for her
 the moment it comes.
 I must keep a good look-out.  She is not now afraid of her brother's
 plot.  I shan't be at all surprised, if Singleton calls upon Miss Howe,
 as the only person who knows, or is likely to know, where Miss Harlowe
 is; pretending to have affairs of importance, and of particular service
 to her, if he can but be admitted to her speech--Of compromise, who
 knows, from her brother?
