relations; but not to Mr. Lovelace, I assure you.
 WEDNESDAY NOON, MARCH 29.
 We cannot always answer for what we can do: but to convince you, that I
 can keep my above resolution, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, angry as my
 letter is, and three hours since it was written, I assure you, that I
 repent it not; nor will soften it, although I find it is not taken away.
 And yet I hardly ever before did any thing in anger, that I did not

 do. A dreadful contention between parents and child!--Each hoping to
 leave the other without excuse, whatever the consequence may be.
 What can I do? Advise me, my dear. Something is strangely wrong
 somewhere! to make parents, the most indulgent till now, seem cruel in
 a child's eye; and a daughter, till within these few weeks, thought
