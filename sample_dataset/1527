charming creature upon proof of her merits?--Do I not intend to reward
 her by marriage, if she stand that proof?
 But why repeat I what I have said before?--Turn back, thou egregious
 arguer, turn back to my long letter of the 13th,* and thou wilt there
 find every syllable of what thou hast written either answered or
 invalidated.
      * See Letter XVIII. of this volume.
 But I am not angry with thee, Jack. I love opposition. As gold is tried
 by fire, and virtue by temptation, so is sterling wit by opposition.
 Have I not, before thou settest out as an advocate for my fair-one,
 often brought thee in, as making objections to my proceedings, for no
 other reason than to exalt myself by proving thee a man of straw? As
 Homer raises up many of his champions, and gives them terrible names,
 only to have them knocked on the head by his heroes.
 However, take to thee this one piece of advice--Evermore be sure of
 being in the right, when thou presumest to sit down to correct thy
 master.
 And another, if thou wilt--Never offer to invalidate the force which
 a virtuous education ought to have in the sex, by endeavouring to find
 excuses for their frailty from the frailty of ours. For, are we not
 devils to each other?--They tempt us--we tempt them. Because we men
 cannot resist temptation, is that a reason that women ought not,
 when the whole of their education is caution and warning against our
 attempts? Do not their grandmothers give them one easy rule--Men are to
 ask--Women are to deny?
 Well, but to return to my principal subject; let me observe, that, be my
 future resolutions what they will, as to this lady, the contents of the
 violent letter she has received have set me at least a month forward
 with her. I can now, as I hinted, talk of love and marriage, without
 controul or restriction; her injunctions no more my terror.
