I wil do my best I am able, since your Honner will be apt to lose her,
 as your Honner says, if I do not; and a man so stingie will be apt
 to gain her. But mayhap my deareste young lady will not make all this
 trubble needful. If she has promissed, she will stand to it, I dare to
 say.
 I love your Honner for contriveing to save mischiff so well. I thought
 till I know'd your Honner, that you was verry mischevous, and plese
 your Honner: but find it to be clene contrary. Your Honner, it is plane,
 means mighty well by every body, as far as I see. As I am sure I do
 myself; for I am, althoff a very plane man, and all that, a very honnest
 one, I thank my God. And have good principels, and have kept my young
 lady's pressepts always in mind: for she goes no where, but saves a soul
 or two, more or less.
 So, commending myself to your Honner's further favour, not forgetting
 the inne, when your Honner shall so please, and good one offers; for
 plases are no inherritanses now-a-days. And, I hope, your Honner will
 not think me a dishonest man for sarving your Honner agenst my duty, as
 it may look; but only as my conshence clears me.
 Be pleased, howsomever, if it like your Honner, not to call me honest
 Joseph, so often. For, althoff I think myself verry honnest, and all
 that, yet I am touched a littel, for fear I should not do the quite
 right thing: and too besides, your Honner has such a fesseshious way
 with you, as that I hardly know whether you are in jest or earnest, when
 your Honner calls me honnest so often.
 I am a very plane man, and seldom have writ to such honourable
 gentlemen; so you will be good enuff to pass by every thing, as I have
 often said, and need not now say over again.
 As to Mrs. Betty; I tho'te, indeed, she looked above me. But she comes
 on vere well, natheless. I could like her better, iff she was better to
 my young lady. But she has too much wit for so plane a man. Natheless,
