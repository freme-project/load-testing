great a love to me as ever.
 You may believe I have been very sincere with him. But he affects
 to rally me, and not to believe it possible, that one so dutiful and
 discreet as his sister Clary can resolve to disoblige all her friends.
 Indeed, I tremble at the prospect before me; for it is evident that they
 are strangely determined.
 My father and mother industriously avoid giving me opportunity of
 speaking to them alone. They ask not for my approbation, intended, as it
 should seem, to suppose me into their will. And with them I shall hope
 to prevail, or with nobody. They have not the interest in compelling me,
 as my brother and sister have: I say less therefore to them, reserving
 my whole force for an audience of my father, if he will permit me a
 patient ear. How difficult is it, my dear, to give a negative where both
 duty and inclination join to make one wish to oblige!
 I have already stood the shock of three of this man's particular visits,
 besides my share in his more general ones; and find it is impossible
 I should ever endure him. He has but a very ordinary share of
 understanding; is very illiterate; knows nothing but the value of
 estates, and how to improve them, and what belongs to land-jobbing and
 husbandry. Yet I am as one stupid, I think. They have begun so cruelly
 with me, that I have not spirit enough to assert my own negative.
 They had endeavoured it seems to influence my good Mrs. Norton before I
 came home--so intent are they to carry their point! And her opinion
 not being to their liking, she has been told that she would do well to
 decline visiting here for the present: yet she is the person of all the
 world, next to my mother, the most likely to prevail upon me, were the
 measures they are engaged in reasonable measures, or such as she could
 think so.
 My aunt likewise having said that she did not think her niece could ever
 be brought to like Mr. Solmes, has been obliged to learn another lesson.
