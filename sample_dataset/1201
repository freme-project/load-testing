'He conjures me, in the most solemn manner, if I would not throw him
 into utter despair, to keep to my appointment.
 'However, instead of threatening my relations, or Solmes, if I recede,
 he respectfully says, that he doubts not, but that, if I do, it will be
 upon the reason, as he ought to be satisfied with; upon no slighter,
 he hopes, than their leaving me at full liberty to pursue my own
 inclinations: in which (whatever they shall be) he will entirely
 acquiesce; only endeavouring to make his future good behaviour the sole
 ground for his expectation of my favour.
 'In short, he solemnly vows, that his whole view, at present, is to free
 me from my imprisonment; and to restore me to my future happiness. He
 declares, that neither the hopes he has of my future favour, nor the
 consideration of his own and his family's honour, will permit him to
 propose any thing that shall be inconsistent with my own most scrupulous
 notions: and, for my mind's sake, should choose to have the proposed end
 obtained by my friends declining to compel me. But that nevertheless, as
 to the world's opinion, it is impossible to imagine that the behaviour
 of my relations to me has not already brought upon my family those
 free censures which they deserve, and caused the step which I am so
 scrupulous about taking, to be no other than the natural and expected
 consequence of their treatment of me.'
 Indeed, I am afraid all this is true: and it is owing to some little
 degree of politeness, that Mr. Lovelace does not say all he might on
 this subject: for I have no doubt that I am the talk, and perhaps the
 bye-word of half the county. If so, I am afraid I can now do nothing
 that will give me more disgrace than I have already so causelessly
 received by their indiscreet persecutions: and let me be whose I
 will, and do what I will, I shall never wipe off the stain which my
 confinement, and the rigorous usage I have received, have fixed upon me;
 at least in my own opinion.
