Must not, Sir!--But I must--you can curse your maid in my absence, as

 Dearest creature, you must not go--you must not leave me--Such determined

 Miss Howe is just; Miss Howe is good, replied she.  She writes, she
 speaks, of every body as they deserve.  If you point me out but any one
 occasion, upon which you have reason to build a merit to yourself, as
