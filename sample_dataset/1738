how (being unpracticed in these matters) to begin to write.  And now,
 good lady, be favourable to
 Your most humble lover,
 and obedient servant,
 ANT. HARLOWE.
 Here's a letter of courtship, my dear!--and let me subjoin to it, that if
 now, or hereafter, I should treat this hideous lover, who is so free with
 me to my mother, with asperity, and you should be disgusted at it, I
 shall think you don't give me that preference in your love which you have
 in mine.
 And now, which shall I first give you; the answer of my good mamma; or
 the dialogue that passed between the widow mother, and the pert daughter,
 upon her letting the latter know that she had a love-letter?
 I think you shall have the dialogue.  But let me promise one thing; that
 if you think me too free, you must not let it run in your head that I am
 writing of your uncle, or of my mother; but of a couple of old lovers, no
 matter whom.  Reverence is too apt to be forgotten by children, where the
 reverends forget first what belongs to their own characters.  A grave
 remark, and therefore at your service, my dear.
 Well then, suppose my mamma, (after twice coming into my closet to me,
 and as often going out, with very meaning features, and lips ready to
 burst open, but still closed, as if by compulsion, a speech going off in
 a slight cough, that never went near the lungs,) grown more resolute the
 third time of entrance, and sitting down by me, thus begin:
 Mother.   I have a very serious matter to talk with you upon, Nancy, when
 you are disposed to attend to matters within ourselves, and not let
 matters without ourselves wholly engross you.
 A good selve-ish speech!--But I thought that friendship, gratitude, and
 humanity, were matters that ought to be deemed of the most intimate
 concern to us.  But not to dwell upon words.
