unbrotherly one.
 Not more unbrotherly than all the rest of his conduct to me, of late,
 Madam, said I. I see by this specimen of his violence, how every body
 has been brought into his measures. Had I any the least apprehension of
 ever being in Mr. Solmes's power, this might have affected me. But you
 see, Sir, to Mr. Solmes, what a conduct is thought necessary to enable
 you to arrive at your ungenerous end. You see how my brother courts for
 you.
 I disclaim Mr. Harlowe's violence, Madam, with all my soul. I will never
 remind you--
 Silence, worthy Sir, said I; I will take care you never shall have the
 opportunity.
 Less violence, Clary, said my uncle. Cousin James, you are as much to
 blame as your sister.
 In then came my sister. Brother, said she, you kept not your promise.
 You are thought to be to blame within, as well as here. Were not Mr.
 Solmes's generosity and affection to the girl well known, what you said
 would have been inexcusable. My father desires to speak with you; and
 with you, Mr. Solmes, if you please.
 They all four withdrew into the next apartment.
 I stood silent, as not knowing presently how to take this intervention
 of my sister's. But she left me not long at a loss--O thou perverse
 thing, said she [poking out her angry face at me, when they were all
 gone, but speaking spitefully low]--what trouble do you give to us all!
 You and my brother, Bella, said I, give trouble to yourselves; yet
 neither you nor he have any business to concern yourselves about me.
 She threw out some spiteful expressions, still in a low voice, as if she
 chose not to be heard without; and I thought it best to oblige her to
 raise her tone a little, if I could. If I could, did I say? It is easy
 to make a passionate spirit answer all one's views upon it.
