Having this authority from her, and being very solicitous about the
 success of the application, I thought, that if the weight of so good a
 wife, mother, and sister, as Mrs. Harlowe is known to be, were thrown
 into the same scale with that of Mr. John Harlowe (supposing he could be

 tell him, that you will have seen Mrs. Harlowe upon the same account; and
 will advise him to join in consultation with her how best to proceed to
 melt the most obdurate heart in the world.
 This is the fair state of the matter, and my true motive for writing to
 you.  I leave all, therefore, to your discretion; and most heartily wish
 success to it; being of opinion that Mr. Lovelace cannot possibly deserve
 our admirable friend: nor indeed know I the man who does.
 Pray acquaint me by a line of the result of your interposition.  If it
 prove not such as may be reasonably hoped for, our dear friend shall know
 nothing of this step from me; and pray let her not from you.  For, in
 that case, it would only give deeper grief to a heart already too much
 afflicted.  I am, dear and worthy Mrs. Norton,
 Your true friend,
 ANNA HOWE.

 favour.  Her poor mother is to be pitied.  I have a most affecting letter
 from her; but must not communicate it to you; and she forbids me to let
