fever; which it seems has been increased by the perturbation of his
 spirits.
 Mr. Wyerley drank tea with us yesterday; and though he is far from being
 partial to Mr. Lovelace, as it may well be supposed, yet both he and Mr.
 Symmes blame your family for the treatment they gave him when he went
 in person to inquire after your brother's health, and to express his
 concern for what had happened.
 They say, that Mr. Lovelace could not avoid drawing his sword: and that
 either your brother's unskilfulness or passion left him from the very
 first pass entirely in his power.
 This, I am told, was what Mr. Lovelace said upon it; retreating as he
 spoke: 'Have a care, Mr. Harlowe--your violence puts you out of your
 defence. You give me too much advantage. For your sister's sake, I will
 pass by every thing:--if--'
 But this the more provoked his rashness, to lay himself open to the
 advantage of his adversary--who, after a slight wound given him in the
 arm, took away his sword.
 There are people who love not your brother, because of his natural
 imperiousness and fierce and uncontroulable temper: these say, that
 the young gentleman's passion was abated on seeing his blood gush
 plentifully down his arm; and that he received the generous offices of
 his adversary (who helped him off with his coat and waistcoat, and bound
 up his arm, till the surgeon could come,) with such patience, as was far
 from making a visit afterwards from that adversary, to inquire after his
 health, appear either insulting or improper.
 Be this as it may, every body pities you. So steady, so uniform in your
 conduct: so desirous, as you always said, of sliding through life to the
 end of it unnoted; and, as I may add, not wishing to be observed
 even for your silent benevolence; sufficiently happy in the noble
 consciousness which attends it: Rather useful than glaring, your
