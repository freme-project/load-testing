from this bosom (if possible with my own hands) were it to scruple to
 give up its ardours to a woman capable of such a preference.
 I told him, that he talked to me in very high language; but he might
 assure himself that I never would have Mr. Solmes, (yet that this I said
 not in favour to him,) and I had declared as much to my relations, were
 there not such a man as himself in the world.
 Would I declare, that I would still honour him with my
 correspondence?--He could not bear, that, hoping to obtain greater
 instances of my favour, he should forfeit the only one he had to boast
 I bid him forbear rashness or resentment to any of my family, and I
 would, for some time at least, till I saw what issue my present trials
 were likely to have, proceed with a correspondence, which, nevertheless,
 my heart condemned--
 And his spirit him, the impatient creature said, interrupting me, for
 bearing what he did; when he considered, that the necessity of it was
 imposed upon him, not by my will, (for then he would bear it cheerfully,
 and a thousand times more,) but by creatures--And there he stopt.
 I told him plainly that he might thank himself (whose indifferent
 character, as to morals, had given such a handle against him) for all.
 It was but just, that a man should be spoken evil of, who set no value
 upon his reputation.
 He offered to vindicate himself. But I told him, I would judge him by
 his own rule--by his actions, not by his professions.
 Were not his enemies, he said, so powerful, and so determined; and had
 they not already shewn their intentions in such high acts of even cruel
 compulsion; but would leave me to my choice, or to my desire of living
 single; he would have been content to undergo a twelvemonth's probation,
 or more: but he was confident, that one month would either complete all
 their purposes, or render them abortive: and I best knew what hopes I
 had of my father's receding--he did not know him, if I had any.
