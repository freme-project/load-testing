the time.  Thus of old did the contending wives of the honest patriarchs;
 each recommending her handmaid to her lord, as she thought it would
 oblige him, and looking upon the genial product as her own.
 The gentle Waller says, women are born to be controuled.  Gentle as he
 was, he knew that.  A tyrant husband makes a dutiful wife.  And why do
 the sex love rakes, but because they know how to direct their uncertain
 wills, and manage them?
 Another agreeable conversation.  The day of days the subject.  As to
 fixing a particular one, that need not be done, my charmer says, till the
 settlements are completed.  As to marrying at my Lord's chapel, the
 Ladies of my family present, that would be making a public affair of it;
 and the dear creature observed, with regret, that it seemed to be my
 Lord's intention to make it so.
 It could not be imagined, I said, but that his Lordship's setting out in
 a litter, and coming to town, as well as his taste for glare, and the joy
 he would take to see me married at last, and to her dear self, would give
 it as much the air of a public marriage as if the ceremony were performed
 at his own chapel, all the Ladies present.
 I cannot, said she, endure the thoughts of a public day.  It will carry
 with it an air of insult upon my whole family.  And for my part, if my
 Lord will not take it amiss, [and perhaps he will not, as the motion came
 not from himself, but from you, Mr. Lovelace,] I will very willingly
 dispense with his Lordship's presence; the rather, as dress and
 appearance will then be unnecessary; for I cannot bear to think of
 decking my person while my parents are in tears.
 How excellent this!  Yet do not her parents richly deserve to be in
 tears?
 See, Belford, with so charming a niceness, we might have been a long time
 ago upon the verge of the state, and yet found a great deal to do before
 we entered into it.
