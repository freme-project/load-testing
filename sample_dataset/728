hates; and so prevent her having the man whom she herself loves (whether
 she have hope of him or not), and whom she suspects her sister loves!
 Poisons and poniard have often been set to work by minds inflamed by
 disappointed love, and actuated by revenge.--Will you wonder, then, that
 the ties of relationship in such a case have no force, and that a sister

 Now I know this to be her secret motive, (the more grating to her, as
 her pride is concerned to make her disavow it), and can consider it

 that they will subdue such a fine spirit as yours, unused to opposition;
 and (tell it not in Gath) you must be Mrs. Solmes!
 Mean time, it is now easy, as you will observe, to guess from what
 quarter the report I mentioned to you in one of my former, came,
 That the younger sister has robbed the elder of her lover:* for Betty
 whispered it, at the time she whispered the rest, that neither Lovelace
 nor you had done honourably by her young mistress.--How cruel, my dear,
 in you, to rob the poor Bella of the only lover she only had!--At the
 instant too that she was priding herself, that now at last she should
 have it in her power not only to gratify her own susceptibilities, but
 to give an example to the flirts of her sex** (my worship's self in
 her eye) how to govern their man with a silken rein, and without a
