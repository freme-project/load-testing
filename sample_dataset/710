No doubt from the same motive that makes him avoid being obliged to his
 relations.
 * Letter IV.
 A person willing to think favourably of him would hope, that a brave, a
 learned, and a diligent, man, cannot be naturally a bad man.--But if he
 be better than his enemies say he is (and if worse he is bad indeed) he
 is guilty of an inexcusable fault in being so careless as he is of his
 reputation. I think a man can be so but from one of these two reasons:
 either that he is conscious he deserves the ill spoken of him; or, that

 Talk of the devil, is an old saying. The lively wretch has made me a
 visit, and is but just gone away. He is all impatience and resentment
 at the treatment you meet with, and full of apprehensions too, that they
