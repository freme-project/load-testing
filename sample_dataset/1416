LETTER XXXV
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SAT., SUNDAY, MONDAY.
      He gives, in several letters, the substance of what is

 she receives, and has perused, a letter from that vixen, than at other
 times. But as the sweet maid shews, even then, more of passive grief,
 than of active spirit, I hope she is rather lamenting than plotting.
 And, indeed, for what now should she plot? when I am become a reformed
 man, and am hourly improving in my morals?--Nevertheless, I must
 contrive some way or other to get at their correspondence--only to see
 the turn of it; that's all.
 But no attempt of this kind must be made yet. A detected invasion, in an
