hard-hearted--my father may be immovable--I may suffer from my brother's
 ambition, and from my sister's envy!--But let me not lose my Mamma's
 love; at least, her pity.
 She turned to me with benigner rays--You have my love! You have my pity!
 But, O my dearest girl--I have not yours.
 Indeed, indeed, Madam, you have: and all my reverence, all my gratitude,

 result from a much worse-tempered man, (a man who has not half the sense
 of my father,) has not made an impression upon me, to the disadvantage
 of the married life? Yet 'tis something of an alleviation, if one must
 bear undue controul, to bear it from a man of sense. My father, I
