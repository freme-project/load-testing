not the series or thread of the story require it.
 I have more than once mentioned to you the darling view some of us have
 long had of raising a family, as it is called. A reflection, as I have
 often thought, upon our own, which is no considerable or upstart one, on
 either side, on my mother's especially.--A view too frequently it
 seems entertained by families which, having great substance, cannot be
 satisfied without rank and title.
 My uncles had once extended this view to each of us three children;
 urging, that as they themselves intended not to marry, we each of
 us might be so portioned, and so advantageously matched, as that
 our posterity, if not ourselves, might make a first figure in our
 country.--While my brother, as the only son, thought the two girls might
 be very well provided for by ten or fifteen thousand pounds a-piece:
 and that all the real estates in the family, to wit, my grandfather's,
 father's, and two uncles', and the remainder of their respective
 personal estates, together with what he had an expectation of from
 his godmother, would make such a noble fortune, and give him such an
 interest, as might entitle him to hope for a peerage. Nothing less would
 satisfy his ambition.
 With this view he gave himself airs very early; 'That his grandfather
 and uncles were his stewards: that no man ever had better: that
 daughters were but incumbrances and drawbacks upon a family:' and this
 low and familiar expression was often in his mouth, and uttered always
 with the self-complaisance which an imagined happy thought can be
 supposed to give the speaker; to wit, 'That a man who has sons brings up
 chickens for his own table,' [though once I made his comparison stagger
 with him, by asking him, If the sons, to make it hold, were to have
 their necks wrung off?] 'whereas daughters are chickens brought up
 for tables of other men.' This, accompanied with the equally polite
 reflection, 'That, to induce people to take them off their hands, the
