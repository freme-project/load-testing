me; my own servant discarded with high marks of undeserved suspicion and
 displeasure, and my sister's maid set over me.
 The matter may be too far pushed.--Indeed it may.--And then, perhaps,
 every one will be sorry for their parts in it.
 May I be permitted to mention an expedient?--'If I am to be
 watched, banished, and confined; suppose, Sir, it were to be at your
 house?'--Then the neighbouring gentry will the less wonder, that the
 person of whom they used to think so favourably, appear not at church
 here; and that she received not their visits.
 I hope there can be no objection to this. You used to love to have
 me with you, Sir, when all went happily with me: And will you not now
 permit me, in my troubles, the favour of your house, till all this
 displeasure is overblown?--Upon my word, Sir, I will not stir out of
 doors, if you require the contrary of me: nor will I see any body, but
 whom you will allow me to see; provided Mr. Solmes be not brought to
 persecute me there.
 Procure, then, this favour for me; if you cannot procure the still
 greater, that of a happy reconciliation (which nevertheless I presume to
 hope for, if you will be so good as to plead for me); and you will then
 add to those favours and to that indulgence, which have bound me, and
 will for ever bind me to be
 Your dutiful and obliged niece, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
 THE ANSWER
 SUNDAY NIGHT.
 MY DEAR NIECE,
 It grieves me to be forced to deny you any thing you ask. Yet it must be
 so; for unless you can bring your mind to oblige us in this one point,
 in which our promises and honour were engaged before we believed there
 could be so sturdy an opposition, you must never expect to be what you
 have been to us all.
