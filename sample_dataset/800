I assure him, 'That were there not such a man in the world as himself, I
 would not have Mr. Solmes.'
 I tell him, 'That to return, as I understand he does, defiances for
 defiances, to my relations, is far from being a proof with me, either of
 his politeness, or of the consideration he pretends to have for me.
 'That the moment I hear he visits any of my friends without their
 consent, I will make a resolution never to see him more, if I can help

 been so handsomely treated by my friends, as he might have expected:
 but that had he even my friends on his side, I should have very great
 objections to him, were I to get over my choice of a single life, so
 really preferable to me as it is; and that I should have declared as
 much to him, had I not regarded him as more than a common visiter. On
 all these accounts, I desire, that the one more letter, which I will
 allow him to deposit in the usual place, may be the very last; and that
 only, to acquaint me with his acquiescence that it shall be so; at least

 This last I put in that he may not be quite desperate. But, if he take
 me at my word, I shall be rid of one of my tormentors.
 I have promised to lay before you all his letters, and my answers: I
 repeat that promise: and am the less solicitous, for that reason, to
 amplify upon the contents of either. But I cannot too often express my
