He was loth, he said to tell me--yet not the least hurt to his person.
 I repeated my question.
 If he must tell me, he only proposed to carry off the poor fellow, and
 to hide him for a month or two. And this he would have done, let what
 would have been the consequence.
 Was ever such a wretch heard of!--I sighed from the bottom of my heart;
 but bid him proceed from the part I had interrupted him at.
 'I ordered the fellow, as I told you, Madam, said he, to keep within
 view of the garden-door: and if he found any parley between us, and any
 body coming (before you could retreat undiscovered) whose coming might
 be attended with violent effects, he should cry out; and this not only
 in order to save himself from their suspicions of him, but to give me
 warning to make off, and, if possible, to induce you (I own it, Madam)
 to go off with me, according to your own appointment. And I hope all
 circumstances considered, and the danger I was in of losing you for
 ever, that the acknowledgement of that contrivance, or if you had not
 met me, that upon Solmes, will not procure me your hatred: for, had they
 come as I expected as well as you, what a despicable wretch had I been,
 could I have left you to the insults of a brother and other of your
 family, whose mercy was cruelty when they had not the pretence with
 which this detected interview would have furnished them!'
 What a wretch! said I.--But if, Sir, taking your own account of this
 strange matter to be fact, any body were coming, how happened it, that I
 saw only that man Leman (I thought it was he) out at the door, and at a
 distance, look after us?
 Very lucky! said he, putting his hand first in one pocket, then in
 another--I hope I have not thrown it away--it is, perhaps, in the coat
 I had on yesterday--little did I think it would be necessary to be
 produced--but I love to come to a demonstration whenever I can--I may
 be giddy--I may be heedless. I am indeed--but no man, as to you, Madam,
