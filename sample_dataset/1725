puts himself in her power.--But I could not do thus by such an angel as
 this, did I not believe that, after her probation time shall be expired,
 and if she be not to be brought to cohabitation, (my darling view,) I
 shall reward her as she wishes.
 Saturday is half over.  We are equally happy--preparing for the play.
 Polly has offered her company, and is accepted.  I have directed her
 where to weep: and this not only to show her humanity, [a weeping eye
 indicates a gentle heart,] but to have a pretence to hide her face with a
 fan or handkerchief.--Yet Polly is far from being every man's girl; and
 we shall sit in the gallery green-box.
 The woes of others, so well represented as those of Belvidera
 particularly will be, must, I hope, unlock and open my charmer's heart.
 Whenever I have been able to prevail upon a girl to permit me to attend
 her to a play, I have thought myself sure of her.  The female heart (all
 gentleness and harmony by nature) expands, and forgets its forms, when
 its attention is carried out of itself at an agreeable or affecting
 entertainment--music, and perhaps a collation afterwards, co-operating.
 Indeed, I have no hope of such an effect here; but I have more than one
 end to answer by getting her to a play.  To name but one.--Dorcas has a
 master-key, as I have told thee.--But it were worth while to carry her to
 the play of Venice Preserved, were it but to show her, that there have
 been, and may be, much deeper distresses than she can possibly know.
 Thus exceedingly happy are we at present.  I hope we shall not find any
 of Nat. Lee's left-handed gods at work, to dash our bowl of joy with
 wormwood.
 R. LOVELACE.
