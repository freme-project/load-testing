been my pride to obey and oblige?--I never asked a favour, that I did
 not first sit down and consider, if it were fit to be granted. And now,
 to shew my obedience, have I not offered to live single?--Have I not
 offered to divest myself of my grandfather's bounty, and to cast myself
 upon my father's! and that to be withdrawn, whenever I disoblige him?
 Why, dear, good Sir, am I to be made unhappy in a point so concerning my

 be surprised, Mr. Solmes, don't be concerned at this. We know, and rapt
 out a sad oath, what women will say in their wrath: the wind is not more
 boisterous, nor more changeable; and again he swore to that.--If you
