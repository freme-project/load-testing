I could not.
 He looked at me with great confidence; as if (notwithstanding his
 contradictory bashfulness) he would look me through; while my eye
 but now-and-then could glance at him.--He begged my pardon with great
 humility: he was afraid I would think he deserved no other answer, but
 that of a contemptuous silence. True love was fearful of offending.
 [Take care, Mr. Lovelace, thought I, how your's is tried by that
 rule]. Indeed so sacred a regard [foolish man!] would he have to all my
 declarations made before I honoured him--
 I would hear him no further; but withdrew in a confusion too visible,
 and left him to make his nonsensical flourishes to himself.
 I will only add, that, if he really wishes for a speedy solemnization,
 he never could have had a luckier time to press for my consent to it.
 But he let it go off; and indignation has taken place of it. And now it
 shall be a point with me, to get him at a distance from me.
 I am, my dearest friend, Your ever faithful and obliged CL. H.
 LETTER XVI
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, APR. 13.
 Why, Jack, thou needest not make such a wonderment, as the girls say, if
 I should have taken large strides already towards reformation: for dost
 thou not see, that while I have been so assiduously, night and day,
 pursuing this single charmer, I have infinitely less to answer for,
 than otherwise I should have had? Let me see, how many days and
 nights?--Forty, I believe, after open trenches, spent in the sap only,
 and never a mine sprung yet!
 By a moderate computation, a dozen kites might have fallen, while I have
 been only trying to ensnare this single lark. Nor yet do I see when
 I shall be able to bring her to my lure: more innocent days yet,
 therefore!--But reformation for my stalking-horse, I hope, will be a
 sure, though a slow method to effect all my purposes.
