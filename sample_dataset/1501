drawn! O my dear! how unhappy have you made every body! Can you expect
 to be happy? Your father wishes you had never been born. Your poor
 mother--but why should I afflict you? There is now no help!--You must be
 changed, indeed, if you are not very unhappy yourself in the reflections
 your thoughtful mind must suggest to you.
 You must now make the best of your lot. Yet not married, it seems!
 It is in your power, you say, to perform whatever you shall undertake
 to do. You may deceive yourself: you hope that your reputation and the
 favour of your friends may be retrieved. Never, never, both, I doubt,

 if ever, there can be no thought of reconciliation. The upshot of your
 precipitation must first be seen. There may be murder yet, as far as we
 know. Will the man you are with part willingly with you? If not, what
 may be the consequence? If he will--Lord bless me! what shall we
 think of his reasons for it?--I will fly this thought. I know your
 purity--But, my dear, are you not out of all protection?--Are you not
 unmarried?--Have you not (making your daily prayers useless) thrown
 yourself into temptation? And is not the man the most wicked of
 plotters?
 You have hitherto, you say, (and I think, my dear, with an air
 unbecoming to your declared penitence,) no fault to find with the
 behaviour of a man from whom every evil was apprehended: like Caesar to
 the Roman augur, which I heard you tell of, who had bid him beware the
 Ides of March: the Ides of March, said Caesar, seeing the augur among
 the crowd, as he marched in state to the senate-house, from which he
