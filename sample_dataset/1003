and have a much weaker judgment, and stronger passions, than you have.
 I have heretofore said, that you have offered as much as you ought, in
 offering to live single. If you were never to marry, the estate they are
 so loth should go out of their name, would, in time, I suppose, revert
 to your brother: and he or his would have it, perhaps, much more
 certainly this way, than by the precarious reversions which Solmes makes
 them hope for. Have you put this into their odd heads, my dear?--The
 tyrant word AUTHORITY, as they use it, can be the only objection against
 this offer.
 One thing you must consider, that, if you leave your parents, your duty
 and love will not suffer you to justify yourself by an appeal against
 them; and so you'll have the world against you. And should Lovelace
 continue his wild life, and behave ungratefully to you, will not his
 baseness seem to justify their cruel treatment of you, as well as their
 dislike of him?
 May heaven direct you for the best!--I can only say, that for my own
 part, I would do any thing, go any where, rather than be compelled to
 marry the man I hate; and (were he such a man as Solmes) must always
 hate. Nor could I have borne what you have borne, if from father and
 uncles, not from brother and sister.
 My mother will have it, that after they have tried their utmost efforts
 to bring you into their measures, and find them ineffectual, they will
 recede. But I cannot say I am of her mind. She does not own, she has
 any authority for this, but her own conjecture. I should otherwise have
 hoped, that your uncle Antony and she had been in on one secret, and
 that favourable to you. Woe be to one of them at least [to you uncle to
 be sure I mean] if they should be in any other!
 You must, if possible, avoid being carried to that uncle's. The man, the
 parson, your brother and sister present!--They'll certainly there marry
 you to the wretch. Nor will your newly-raised spirit support you in your
