I thought she would beat me. But I proceeded--I have heard often of my
 brother's danger, and my brother's murderer. When so little ceremony is
 made with me, why should I not speak out?--Did he not seek to kill the
 other, if he could have done it? Would my brother have given Lovelace
 his life, had it been in his power?--The aggressor should not
 complain.--And, as to opportune offers, would to Heaven some one
 had offered opportunely to somebody! It is not my fault, Bella, the
 opportune gentleman don't come!
 Could you, my dear, have shewn more spirit? I expected to feel the
 weight of her hand. She did come up to me, with it held up: then,
 speechless with passion, ran half way down the stairs, and came up
 again.
 When she could speak--God give me patience with you!
 Amen, said I: but you see, Bella, how ill you bear the retort you
 provoke. Will you forgive me; and let me find a sister in you, as I am
 sorry, if you had reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said?
 Then did she pour upon me, with greater violence; considering my
 gentleness as a triumph of temper over her. She was resolved, she said,
 to let every body know how I took the wicked Lovelace's part against my
 brother.
 I wished, I told her, I could make the plea for myself, which she
 might for herself; to wit, that my anger was more inexcusable than my
 judgment. But I presumed she had some other view in coming to me, than
 she had hitherto acquainted me with. Let me, said I, but know (after
 all that has passed) if you have any thing to propose that I can comply
 with; any thing that can make my only sister once more my friend?
 I had before, upon hearing her ridiculing me on my supposed character of
 meekness, said, that, although I wished to be thought meek, I would not
 be abject; although humble not mean: and here, in a sneering way, she
 cautioned me on that head.
