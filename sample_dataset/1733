lounging lubbers of them; and that at first sight--only that she would
 have been angry at the confession of our continued correspondence.
 But, my dear, let the articles be drawn up, and engrossed; and solemnize
 upon them; and there's no more to be said.
 Let me add, that the sailor-fellow has been tampering with my Kitty, and
 offered a bribe, to find where to direct to you.  Next time he comes, I
 will have him laid hold of; and if I can get nothing out of him, will
 have him drawn through one of our deepest fishponds.  His attempt to
 corrupt a servant of mine will justify my orders.
 I send this letter away directly.  But will follow it by another; which
 shall have for its subject only my mother, myself, and your uncle Antony.
 And as your prospects are more promising than they have been, I will
 endeavour to make you smile upon the occasion.  For you will be pleased
 to know, that my mother has had a formal tender from that grey goose,
 which may make her skill in settlements useful to herself, were she to
 encourage it.
 May your prospects be still more and more happy, prays
 Your own,
 ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER XLIII
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE
 SAT. SUNDAY, MAY 20, 21.
 Now, my dear, for the promised subject.  You must not ask me how I came
 by the originals [such they really are] that I am going to present you
 with: for my mother would not read to me those parts of your uncle's
 letter which bore hard upon myself, and which leave him without any title
 to mercy from me: nor would she let me hear but what she pleased of her's
 in answer; for she has condescended to answer him--with a denial,
 however; but such a denial as no one but an old bachelor would take from
 a widow.
