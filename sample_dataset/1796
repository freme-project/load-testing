reasonably hoped for: and so much VIGILANCE, so much apprehensiveness,
 that her fears are ever aforehand with her dangers.  Then her LOVE or
 VIRTUE seems to be principle, native principle, or, if not native, so
 deeply rooted, that its fibres have struck into her heart, and, as she
 grew up, so blended and twisted themselves with the strings of life, that
 I doubt there is no separating of the one without cutting the others
 asunder.
 What then can be done to make such a matchless creature get over the
 first tests, in order to put her to the grand proof, whether once
