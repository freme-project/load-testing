 new-fronting, and not in condition to receive him: but he could go to
 his friend Belford's, in Soho; or perhaps he might reach to the same
 gentleman's house at Edgware, over night, and return on the mornings,
 till he had reason to think this wild project of my brother's laid

 The result of all was, to set out on Monday next for town. I hope it
 will be in a happy hour.

 [As it was not probable that the Lady could give so particular an
 account of her own confusion, in the affecting scene she mentions on Mr.
 Lovelace's offering himself to her acceptance, the following extracts

 And now, Belford, what wilt thou say, if, like the fly buzzing about the
 bright taper, I had like to have singed the silken wings of my liberty?

 brought to town; nor one effort made to know if she be really angel or
 woman.
 I offered myself to her acceptance, with a suddenness, 'tis true, that
 gave her no time to wrap herself in reserves; and in terms less tender
 than fervent, tending to upbraid her for her past indifference, and to
