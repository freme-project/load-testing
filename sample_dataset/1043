observation he dwells; but regrets, that he is likely to owe all his
 hopes to this compulsion; this injudicious compulsion, he justly calls
 it; and none to my esteem for him. Although he presumes upon some
 merit--in this implicit regard to my will--in the bearing the daily
 indignities offered not only to him, but to his relations, by my
 brother--in the nightly watchings, his present indisposition makes him
 mention, or he had not debased the nobleness of his passion for me, by
 such a selfish instance.'
 I cannot but say, I am sorry the man is not well.
 I am afraid to ask you, my dear, what you would have done, thus
 situated. But what I have done, I have done. In a word, I wrote, 'That
 I would, if possible, give him a meeting to-morrow night, between the
 hours of nine and twelve, by the ivy summer-house, or in it, or near the
 great cascade, at the bottom of the garden; and would unbolt the door,
 that he might come in by his own key. But that, if I found the meeting
 impracticable, or should change my mind, I would signify as much by
 another line; which he must wait for until it were dark.'
 TUESDAY, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
 I am just returned from depositing my billet. How diligent is this man!
 It is plain he was in waiting: for I had walked but a few paces, after I
 had deposited it, when, my heart misgiving me, I returned, to have taken
 it back, in order to reconsider it as I walked, and whether I should or
 should not let it go. But I found it gone.
 In all probability, there was but a brick wall, of a few inches thick,
 between Mr. Lovelace and me, at the very time I put the letter under the
 brick!
 I am come back dissatisfied with myself. But I think, my dear, there
 can be no harm in meeting him. If I do not, he may take some violent
 measures. What he knows of the treatment I meet with in malice to him,
 and with the view to frustrate all his hopes, may make him desperate.
