should be treated rather as a servant than a sister:--perhaps, not the
 better because I am his sister. And if Mr. Lovelace should follow me,
 things might be worse than they are now.
 But I have besought my mother, who is apprehensive of Mr. Lovelace's
 visits, and for fear of whom my uncles never stir out without arms and
 armed servants (my brother also being near well enough to go abroad),
 to procure me permission to be your guest for a fortnight, or so.--Will
 your mother, think you, my dear, give me leave?
 I dare not ask to go to my dairy-house, as my good grandfather would
 call it: for I am now afraid of being thought to have a wish to enjoy
 that independence to which his will has entitled me: and as matter are
 situated, such a wish would be imputed to my regard to the man to whom
 they have now so great an antipathy. And indeed could I be as easy and
 happy here as I used to be, I would defy that man and all his sex; and
 never repent that I have given the power of my fortune into my father's
 hands.
 Just now, my mother has rejoiced me with the news that my requested
 permission is granted. Every one thinks it best that I should go to you,
 except my brother. But he was told, that he must not expect to rule in
 every thing. I am to be sent for into the great parlour, where are my
 two uncles and my aunt Hervey, and to be acquainted with this concession
 in form.
 You know, my dear, that there is a good deal of solemnity among us.
 But never was there a family more united in its different branches than
 ours. Our uncles consider us as their own children, and declare that it
 is for our sakes that they live single. So that they are advised
 with upon every article relating to us, or that may affect us. It is
 therefore the less wonder, at a time when they understand that Mr.
 Lovelace is determined to pay us an amicable visit, as he calls it, (but
 which I am sure cannot end amicably,) that they should both be consulted
