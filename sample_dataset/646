 LETTER XLIII. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Hardly doubts but her proposals

 her in a fury. She is greatly disturbed at the contents of a letter from

 LETTER XLIV. From the same.--Her aunt Hervey, accompanied by her sister,
 makes her a visit. Farther insults from her sister. Her aunt's fruitless
 pleas in Solmes's favour.
