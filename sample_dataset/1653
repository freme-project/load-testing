MISS HOWE, TO MRS. JUDITH NORTON
 THURSDAY, MAY 11.
 GOOD MRS. NORTON,
 Cannot you, without naming me as an adviser, who am hated by the family,
 contrive a way to let Mrs. Harlowe know, that in an accidental
 conversation with me, you had been assured that my beloved friend pines
 after a reconciliation with her relations?  That she has hitherto, in
 hopes of it, refused to enter into any obligation that shall be in the
 least a hinderance [sic] to it: that she would fain avoid giving Mr.
 Lovelace a right to make her family uneasy in relation to her
 grandfather's estate: that all she wishes for still is to be indulged in
 her choice of a single life, and, on that condition, would make her
 father's pleasure her's with regard to that estate: that Mr. Lovelace is
 continually pressing her to marry him; and all his friends likewise: but
 that I am sure she has so little liking to the man, because of his faulty
 morals, and of the antipathy of her relations to him, that if she had any
 hope given her of a reconciliation, she would forego all thoughts of him,
 and put herself into her father's protection.  But that their resolution
 must be speedy; for otherwise she would find herself obliged to give way
 to his pressing entreaties; and it might then be out of her power to
 prevent disagreeable litigations.
 I do assure you, Mrs. Norton, upon my honour, that our dearest friend
 knows nothing of this procedure of mine: and therefore it is proper to
 acquaint you, in confidence, with my grounds for it.--These are they:
 She had desired me to let Mr. Hickman drop hints to the above effect to
 her uncle Harlowe; but indirectly, as from himself, lest, if the
 application should not be attended with success, and Mr. Lovelace (who
 already takes it ill that he has so little of her favour) come to know
 it, she may be deprived of every protection, and be perhaps subjected to
 great inconveniencies from so haughty a spirit.
