As he must, to be so constantly near us, be much there, I would be glad
 to have some account of his behaviour; and what the people think of him.
 In such a length of time, he must by his conduct either give scandal,
 or hope of reformation. Pray, my dear, humour me in this inquiry. I have
 reason for it, which you shall be acquainted with another time, if the
 result of the inquiry discover them not.
 LETTER XX
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY MORNING, NINE O'CLOCK.
 I am just returned from my morning walk, and already have received a
 letter from Mr. Lovelace in answer to mine deposited last night. He
 must have had pen, ink, and paper with him; for it was written in the
 coppice; with this circumstance: On one knee, kneeling with the other.
 Not from reverence to the written to, however, as you'll find!
 Well we are instructed early to keep these men at distance. An
 undesigning open heart, where it is loth to disoblige, is easily drawn
 in, I see, to oblige more than ever it designed. It is too apt to govern
 itself by what a bold spirit is encouraged to expect of it. It is very
 difficult for a good-natured young person to give a negative where it
 disesteems not.
 Our hearts may harden and contract, as we gain experience, and when we
 have smarted perhaps for our easy folly: and so they ought, or we should
 be upon very unequal terms with the world.
 Excuse these grave reflections. This man has vexed me heartily. I see
 his gentleness was art: fierceness, and a temper like what I have been
 too much used to at home, are Nature in him. Nothing, I think, shall
 ever make me forgive him; for, surely, there can be no good reason for
 his impatience on an expectation given with reserve, and revocable.--I
 so much to suffer through him; yet, to be treated as if I were obliged
 to bear insults from him--!
 But here you will be pleased to read his letter; which I shall enclose.
