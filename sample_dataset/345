used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
 the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
 of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually

 been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
 "You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
 the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the

 "Then the page we have seen--"
 "Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
