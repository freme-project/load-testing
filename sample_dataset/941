this light, I should be inexcusable to be the latter. But why do I enter
 upon a supposition of this nature?--My heart, as I have often, often
 said, recoils, at the thought of the man, in every light.--Whose father,
 but mine, agrees upon articles where there is no prospect of a liking?
 Where the direct contrary is avowed, all along avowed, without the
 least variation, or shadow of a change of sentiment?--But it is not my
 father's doing originally. O my cruel, cruel brother, to cause a measure
 to be forced upon me, which he would not behave tolerably under, were
 the like to be offered to him!
 The girl is got into her altitudes, Aunt Hervey, said my sister. You
 see, Madam, she spares nobody. Be pleased to let her know what she has
 to trust to. Nothing is to be done with her. Pray, Madam, pronounce her
 doom.
 My aunt retired to the window, weeping, with my sister in her hand:
 I cannot, indeed I cannot, Miss Harlowe, said she, softly, (but yet I
 heard every word she said): there is great hardship in her case. She
 is a noble child after all. What pity things are gone so far!--But Mr.
 Solmes ought to be told to desist.
 O Madam, said my sister, in a kind of loud whisper, are you caught too
 by the little siren?--My mother did well not to come up!--I question
 whether my father himself, after his first indignation, would not be
 turned round by her. Nobody but my brother can do any thing with her, I
 am sure.
 Don't think of your brother's coming up, said my aunt, still in a low
 voice--He is too furious. I see no obstinacy, no perverseness, in
 her manner! If your brother comes, I will not be answerable for the
 consequences: for I thought twice or thrice she would have gone into
 fits.
 O Madam, she has a strong heart!--And you see there is no prevailing
 with her, though you were upon your knees to her.
