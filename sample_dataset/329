refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
 which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told
 of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about
 him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his
 face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
 weighed down with some great anxiety.
 "I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
 his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have
 brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
 chamber."
 "Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest
 here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from
 the south-west, I see."
 "Yes, from Horsham."
 "That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is
 quite distinctive."
 "I have come for advice."
 "That is easily got."
 "And help."
 "That is not always so easy."
 "I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast
 how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."
 "Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
 "He said that you could solve anything."
 "He said too much."
 "That you are never beaten."
 "I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a
 woman."
 "But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
 "It is true that I have been generally successful."
