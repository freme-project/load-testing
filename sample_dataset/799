It is natural, I believe, for a person to be the more desirous of making
 new friends, in proportion as she loses the favour of old ones. Yet had
 I rather appear amiable in the eyes of my own relations, and in your
 eyes, than in those of all the world besides--but these four ladies of
 his family have such excellent characters, that one cannot but wish to
 be thought well of by them. Cannot there be a way to find out, by Mrs.
 Fortescue's means, or by Mr. Hickman, who has some knowledge of Lord M.
 [covertly, however,] what their opinions are of the present situation of
 things in our family; and of the little likelihood there is, that ever
 the alliance once approved of by them, can take effect?
 I cannot, for my own part, think so well of myself, as to imagine, that
 they can wish their kinsman to persevere in his views with regard to me,
 through such contempts and discouragements.--Not that it would concern
 me, should they advise him to the contrary. By my Lord's signing Mr.
 Lovelace's former letter; by Mr. Lovelace's assurances of the continued
 favour of all his relations; and by the report of others; I seem still
 to stand high in their favour. But, methinks, I should be glad to have
 this confirmed to me, as from themselves, by the lips of an indifferent
 person; and the rather, because of their fortunes and family; and take
 it amiss (as they have reason) to be included by ours in the contempt
 thrown upon their kinsman.
 Curiosity at present is all my motive: nor will there ever, I hope, be a
 stronger, notwithstanding your questionable throbs--even were the merits
 of Mr. Lovelace much greater than they are.
 I have answered his letters. If he takes me at my word, I shall need to
 be less solicitous for the opinions of his relations in my favour: and
 yet one would be glad to be well thought of by the worthy.
 This is the substance of my letter:
 'I express my surprise at his knowing (and so early) all that passes
 here.'
