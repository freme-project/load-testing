You ask me to advise you how to behave upon Solmes's visit. I cannot for
 my life. I know they expect a great deal from it: you had not else had
 your long day complied with. All I will say is, That if Solmes cannot
 be prevailed for, now that Lovelace has so much offended you, he never
 will. When the interview is over, I doubt not but that I shall have
 reason to say, that all you did, that all you said, was right, and could
 not be better: yet, if I don't think so, I won't say so; that I promise
 you.
 Only let me advise you to pull up a spirit, even to your uncle, if there
 be occasion. Resent the vile and foolish treatment you meet with, in
 which he has taken so large a share, and make him ashamed of it, if you
 can.
 I know not, upon recollection, but this interview may be a good thing
 for you, however designed. For when Solmes sees (if that be to be so)
 that it is impossible he should succeed with you; and your relations see
 it too; the one must, I think, recede, and the other come to terms with
 you, upon offers, that it is my opinion, will go hard enough with you to
 comply with; when the still harder are dispensed with.
 There are several passages in your last letters, as well as in your
 former, which authorize me to say this. But it would be unseasonable to
 touch this subject farther just now.
 But, upon the whole, I have no patience to see you thus made sport of
 your brother's and sister's cruelty: For what, after so much steadiness
 on your part, in so many trials, can be their hope? except indeed it be
 to drive you to extremity, and to ruin you in the opinion of your uncles
 as well as father.
 I urge you by all means to send out of their reach all the letters
 and papers you would not have them see. Methinks, I would wish you to
 deposit likewise a parcel of clothes, linen, and the like, before your
 interview with Solmes: lest you should not have an opportunity for it
