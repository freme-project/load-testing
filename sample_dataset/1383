His ingenuousness is the thing that staggers me: yet is he cunning
 enough to know, that whoever accuses him first, blunts the edge of an
 adversary's accusation.
 He is certainly a man of sense: there is more hope of such a one than a
 fool: and there must be a beginning to a reformation. These I will allow
 in his favour.
 But this, that follows, I think, is the only way to judge of his
 specious confessions and self-accusations--Does he confess any thing
 that you knew not before, or that you are not likely to find out from
 others?--If nothing else, what does he confess to his own disadvantage?
 You have heard of his duels: you have heard of his seductions.--All
 the world has. He owns, therefore, what it would be to no purpose to

 than Mr. Lovelace himself acknowledges.'
 Well, but what is now to be done?--You must make the best of your
 situation: and as you say, so he has proposed to you of Windsor, and his
 canon's house. His readiness to leave you, and go himself in quest of
 a lodging, likewise looks well. And I think there is nothing can be so

 canon should join you together in wedlock as soon as possible.
 I much approve, however, of all your cautions, of all your vigilance,
 and of every thing you have done, but of your meeting him. Yet, in my
 disapprobation of that, I judge by that event only: for who would have
 divined it would have been concluded as it did? But he is the devil by
 his own account: and had he run away with the wretched Solmes, and your
 more wretched brother, and himself been transported for life, he should
 have had my free consent for all three.
 What use does he make of that Joseph Leman!--His ingenuousness, I must
 more than once say, confounds me; but if, my dear, you can forgive
 your brother for the part he put that fellow upon acting, I don't know
