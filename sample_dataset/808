men in England--'
 I think little of my mother's politest, my dear. She judges of honest
 Hickman for her daughter, as she would have done, I suppose, twenty
 years ago, for herself.
 'Of a good family, continued my mother; a fine, clear, and improving
 estate [a prime consideration with my mother, as well as with some other
 folks, whom you know]: and I beg and I pray you to encourage him: at
 least not to use him the worse, for his being so obsequious to you.'
 Yes, indeed! To use him kindly, that he may treat me familiarly--but
 distance to the men-wretches is best--I say.
 'Yet all will hardly prevail upon you to do as I would have you. What
 would you say, were I to treat you as Miss Harlowe's father and mother
 treat her?
 'What would I say, Madam!--That's easily answered. I would say nothing.
 Can you think such usage, and to such a young lady, is to be borne?
 'Come, come, Nancy, be not so hasty: you have heard but one side; and
 that there is more to be said is plain, by your reading to me but parts
 of her letters. They are her parents. They must know best. Miss Harlowe,
 as fine a child as she is, must have done something, must have said
 something, (you know how they loved her,) to make them treat her thus.
 'But if she should be blameless, Madam, how does your own supposition
 condemn them?'
 Then came up Solmes's great estate; his good management of it--'A little
 too NEAR indeed,' was the word!--[O how money-lovers, thought I, will
 palliate! Yet my mother is a princess in spirit to this Solmes!] 'What
 strange effects, added she, have prepossession and love upon young
 ladies!'
 I don't know how it is, my dear; but people take high delight in finding
 out folks in love. Curiosity begets curiosity. I believe that's the
 thing.
