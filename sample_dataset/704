LETTER XI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1.
 You both nettled and alarmed me, my dearest Miss Howe, by the concluding
 part of your last. At first reading it, I did not think it necessary,

 which our whole family (my brother excepted) has had a share, that he
 was permitted to visit us with a hope, which, however, being distant,
 did not, as I have observed heretofore,* entitle any of us to call
 him to account for such of his immoralities as came to our ears. Next,
 because I think him to be a vain man, capable of triumphing (secretly at
