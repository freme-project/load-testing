at once, for I have only half an hour."
 My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the
 effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were
 few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a
 cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock
 Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt
 figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
 travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
 "It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It
 makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on
 whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless
 or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall
 get the tickets."
 We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
 papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged
 and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until
 we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a
 gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
 "Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
 "Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
 "The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
 been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
 particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those
 simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
 "That sounds a little paradoxical."
 "But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a
 clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
 difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they
 have established a very serious case against the son of the
 murdered man."
