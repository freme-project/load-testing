one--Ah! my sweet friend!--But I hope he is nothing to you, if all this
 were truth.--But this intelligence, in relation to this poor girl, will
 do his business, if you had been ever so good friends before.
 A vile wretch! Cannot such purity in pursuit, in view, restrain him? but
 I leave him to you!--There can be no hope of him. More of a fool,
 than of such a man. Yet I wish I may be able to snatch the poor young
 creature out of his villainous paws. I have laid a scheme to do so; if
 indeed she be hitherto innocent and heart-free.
 He appears to the people as a military man, in disguise, secreting
 himself on account of a duel fought in town; the adversary's life in
 suspense. They believe he is a great man. His friend passes for an
 inferior officer; upon a footing of freedom with him. He, accompanied by
 a third man, who is a sort of subordinate companion to the second. The
 wretch himself with but one servant.
 O my dear! how pleasantly can these devils, as I must call them, pass
 their time, while our gentle bosoms heave with pity for their supposed
 sufferings for us!

 I have sent for this girl and her father; and am just now informed, that
 I shall see them. I will sift them thoroughly. I shall soon find out
 such a simple thing as this, if he has not corrupted her already--and if
 he has, I shall soon find out that too.--If more art than nature appears
 either in her or her father, I shall give them both up--but depend upon
 it, the girl's undone.
 He is said to be fond of her. He places her at the upper end of his
 table. He sets her a-prattling. He keeps his friends at a distance from
 her. She prates away. He admires for nature all she says. Once was heard
 to call her charming little creature! An hundred has he called so no
 doubt. He puts her upon singing. He praises her wild note--O my dear,
 the girl's undone!--must be undone!--The man, you know, is LOVELACE.
