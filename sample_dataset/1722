comedies, in order to laugh away compunction on the distresses they have
 occasioned, and to find examples of men as immoral as themselves.  For
 very few of our comic performances, as thou knowest, give us good ones.--
 I answer, however, for myself--yet thou, I think, on recollection, lovest
 to deal in the lamentable.
 Sally answered for Polly, who was absent; Mrs. Sinclair for herself, and
 for all her acquaintance, even for Miss Partington, in preferring the
 comic to the tragic scenes.--And I believe they are right; for the
 devil's in it, if a confided-in rake does not give a girl enough of
 tragedy in his comedy.
 'I asked Sally to oblige my fair-one with her company.  She was engaged,
 [that was right, thou'lt suppose].  I asked Mrs. Sinclair's leave for
 Polly.  To be sure, she answered, Polly would think it an honour to
 attend Mrs. Lovelace: but the poor thing was tender-hearted; and as the
 tragedy was deep, would weep herself blind.
 'Sally, meantime, objected Singleton, that I might answer the objection,
 and save my beloved the trouble of making it, or debating the point with
 me; and on this occasion I regretted that her brother's projects were not
 laid aside; since, if they had been given up, I would have gone in person
 to bring up the ladies of my family to attend my spouse.
 'I then, from a letter just before received from one in her father's
 family, warned them of a person who had undertaken to find us out, and
 whom I thus in writing [having called for pen and ink] described, that
 they might arm all the family against him--"A sun-burnt, pock-fretten
 sailor, ill-looking, big-boned; his stature about six foot; an heavy eye,
 an overhanging brow, a deck-treading stride in his walk; a couteau
 generally by his side; lips parched from his gums, as if by staring at
 the sun in hot climates; a brown coat; a coloured handkerchief about his
 neck; an oaken plant in his hand near as long as himself, and
 proportionately thick."
