If I can have her without marriage, who can blame me for trying? If not,
 great will be her glory, and my future confidence. And well will she
 merit the sacrifice I shall make her of my liberty; and from all her sex
 honours next to divine, for giving a proof, 'that there was once a woman
 whose virtue no trials, no stratagems, no temptations, even from the man
 she hated not, could overpower.'
 Now wilt thou see all my circulation: as in a glass wilt thou see
 it.--CABALA, however, is the word;* nor let the secret escape thee even
 in thy dreams.
      * This word, whenever used by any of these gentlemen, was agreed to imply
 an inviolable secret.
 Nobody doubts that she is to be my wife. Let her pass for such when I
 give the word. 'Mean time reformation shall be my stalking-horse; some
 one of the women in London, if I can get her hither, my bird.' And so
 much for this time.
 LETTER XIX
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO LETTERS IX. XV.]
 Do not be so much concerned, my dearest friend, at the bickerings
 between my mother and me. We love one another dearly notwithstanding.
 If my mother had not me to find fault with, she must find fault with
 somebody else. And as to me, I am a very saucy girl; and were not this
 occasion, there would be some other, to shew it.
 You have heard me say, that this was always the case between us.
 You could not otherwise have known it. For when you was with us, you
 harmonized us both; and, indeed, I was always more afraid of you than of
 my mother. But then that awe is accompanied with love. Your reproofs,
 as I have always found, are so charmingly mild and instructive; so
 evidently calculated to improve, and not to provoke; that a generous
 temper must be amended by them. But hear now, mind my good mamma, when
 you are not with us--You shall, I tell you, Nancy. I will have it so.
