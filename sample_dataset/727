that ought to be sacred.--But should not parents have reason for what
 they do?
 Wonder not, however, at your Bell's unsisterly behaviour in this affair:
 I have a particular to add to the inducements your insolent brother is
 governed by, which will account for all her driving. You have already
 owned, that her outward eye was from the first struck with the figure
 and address of the man whom she pretends to despise, and who, 'tis
 certain, thoroughly despises her: but you have not told me, that still
 she loves him of all men. Bell has a meanness in her very pride; that
 meanness rises with her pride, and goes hand in hand with it; and no

 and sleepless nights, and her revenge grafted upon her love, to her
 favourite Betty Barnes--To lay herself in the power of a servant's
 tongue! Poor creature!--But LIKE little souls will find one another

 wench in strict confidence: and thus, by way of the female round-about,
 as Lovelace had the sauciness on such another occasion, in ridicule of
 our sex, to call it, Betty (pleased to be thought worthy of a secret,
 and to have an opportunity of inveighing against Lovelace's perfidy,
 as she would have it to be) told it to one of her confidants:
 that confidant, with like injunctions of secrecy, to Miss Lloyd's
 Harriot--Harriot to Miss Lloyd--Miss Lloyd to me--I to you--with leave
 to make what you please of it.
 And now you will not wonder to find Miss Bell an implacable rival,
 rather than an affectionate sister; and will be able to account for the
 words witchcraft, syren, and such like, thrown out against you; and for
 her driving on for a fixed day for sacrificing you to Solmes: in short,
 for her rudeness and violence of every kind.
 What a sweet revenge will she take, as well upon Lovelace as upon you,
 if she can procure her rival sister to be married to the man that sister
