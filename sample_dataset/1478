have. My conscience touched me just then. But why shoulde it? when all I
 do is to prevent mischeff; and seeing your Honner has so much patience,
 which younge master has not; so am not affeard of telling your Honner
 any thing whatsomever.
 And furthermore, I have such a desire to desarve your Honner's bounty
 to me, as mackes me let nothing pass I can tell you of, to prevent harm:
 and too, besides, your Honner's goodness about the Blew Bore; which I

 talck--to be sure your Honner will not do her no harme, as a man may
 say. But I kno' your Honner must be good to so wonderous a younge lady.
 How can you help it?--But here my conscience smites me, that, but for
