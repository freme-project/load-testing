"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
 "Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
 father's place of business?"
 "He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers
 of Fenchurch Street."
 "Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
 leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
 you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it

 Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips
 still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,
 and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down

 the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of
 infinite languor in his face.
 "Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found
 her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
 is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
 consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
 the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,
 there were one or two details which were new to me. But the
 maiden herself was most instructive."
