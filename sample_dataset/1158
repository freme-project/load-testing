LETTER XXXVI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY, FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE
 AFTERNOON
 I am just returned from depositing the letter I so lately finished, and
 such of Mr. Lovelace's letters as I had not sent you. My long letter I
 found remaining there--so you will have both together.
 I am convinced, methinks, it is not with you.--But your servant cannot
 always be at leisure. However, I will deposit as fast as I write. I must
 keep nothing by me now; and when I write, lock myself in, that I may not
 be surprised now they think I have no pen and ink.
 I found in the usual place another letter from this diligent man: and,
 by its contents, a confirmation that nothing passes in this house but
 he knows it; and that almost as soon as it passes. For this letter
 must have been written before he could have received my billet; and
 deposited, I suppose, when that was taken away; yet he compliments me in
 it upon asserting myself (as he calls it) on that occasion to my uncle
 and to Mr. Solmes.
 'He assures me, however, that they are more and more determined to
 subdue me.
 'He sends me the compliments of his family; and acquaints me with their
 earnest desire to see me amongst them. Most vehemently does he press for
 my quitting this house, while it is in my power to get away: and again
 craves leave to order his uncle's chariot-and-six to attend my commands
 at the stile leading to the coppice adjoining to the paddock.
 'Settlements to my own will he again offers. Lord M. and Lady Sarah and
 Lady Betty to be guarantees of his honour and justice. But, if I choose
 not to go to either of those ladies, nor yet to make him the happiest of
 men so soon as it is nevertheless his hope that I will, he urges me to
 withdraw to my own house, and to accept of Lord M. for my guardian and
 protector till my cousin Morden arrives. He can contrive, he says,
