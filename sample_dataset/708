 writing) has told her, that his thoughts flow rapidly to his pen:' And
 you and I, my dear, have observed, on more occasions than one, that
 though he writes even a fine hand, he is one of the readiest and
 quickest of writers. He must indeed have had early a very docile genius;
 since a person of his pleasurable turn and active spirit, could
 never have submitted to take long or great pains in attaining the
 qualifications he is master of; qualifications so seldom attained by
 youth of quality and fortune; by such especially of those of either,

 to be read. He must be conscious of this, since Mrs. Fortescue says,
 'that in the great correspondence by letters which he holds, he is
 as secret and as careful as if it were of a treasonable nature;--yet
