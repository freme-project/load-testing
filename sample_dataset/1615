reservedly to Mr. Solmes: and that it is contrary to all his hopes and
 notions, that he should not, in so long a time, find himself able to
 inspire the person, whom he hoped so soon to have the honour to call his,
 with the least distinguishing tenderness for him before-hand.'
 Silly and partial encroacher! not to know to what to attribute the
 reserve I am forced to treat him with!  But his pride has eaten up his
 prudence.  It is indeed a dirty low pride, that has swallowed up the true
 pride which should have set him above the vanity that has overrun him.
 Yet he pretends that he has no pride but in obliging me: and is always
 talking of his reverence and humility, and such sort of stuff: but of
 this I am sure that he has, as I observed the first time I saw him,* too
 much regard to his own person, greatly to value that of his wife, marry
 he whom he will: and I must be blind, if I did not see that he is
 exceedingly vain of his external advantages, and of that address, which,
 if it has any merit in it to an outward eye, is perhaps owing more to his
 confidence that [sic] to any thing else.
 * See Vol. I. Letter III.
 Have you not beheld the man, when I was your happy guest, as he walked to
 his chariot, looking about him, as if to observe what eyes his specious
 person and air had attracted?
 But indeed we had some homely coxcombs as proud as if they had persons to
 be proud of; at the same time that it was apparent, that the pains they
 took about themselves but the more exposed their defects.
 The man who is fond of being thought more or better than he is, as I have
 often observed, but provokes a scrutiny into his pretensions; and that
 generally produces contempt.  For pride, as I believe I have heretofore
 said, is an infallible sign of weakness; of something wrong in the head
 or in both.  He that exalts himself insults his neighbour; who is
 provoked to question in him even that merit, which, were he modest, would
 perhaps be allowed to be his due.
