They are very wicked: for in spite of your virtue they conclude you to
 be ruined. But if they can be assured when they have you that you are
 not, they will secure you till they can bring you out Mrs. Solmes. Mean
 time, in order to give Mr. Lovelace full employment, they talk of a
 prosecution which will be set up against him, for some crime they have
 got a notion of, which they think, if it do not cost him his life, will
 make him fly his country.
 This is very early news. Miss Bell told it in confidence, and with
 mighty triumph over Lovelace, to Miss Lloyd, who is at present her
 favourite, though as much you admirer as ever. Miss Lloyd, being very
 apprehensive of the mischief which might follow such an attempt, told
 it to me, with leave to apprize you privately of it--and yet neither
 she nor I would be sorry, perhaps, if Lovelace were to be fairly
 hanged--that is to say, if you, my dear, had no objection to it. But
 we cannot bear that such an admirable creature should be made the
 tennis-ball of two violent spirits--much less that you should be seized,
 and exposed to the brutal treatment of wretches who have no bowels.
 If you can engage Mr. Lovelace to keep his temper upon it, I think you
 should acquaint him with it, but not to mention Miss Lloyd. Perhaps his
 wicked agent may come at the intelligence, and reveal it to him. But
 leave it to your own discretions to do as you think fit in it. All my
 concern is, that this daring and foolish project, if carried on, will
 be a mean of throwing you more into his power than ever. But as it will
 convince you that there can be no hope of a reconciliation, I wish you
 were actually married, let the cause for prosecution hinted at be what
 it will, short of murder or a rape.
 Your Hannah was very thankful for your kind present. She heaped a
 thousand blessings upon you for it. She has Mr. Lovelace's too by this
 time.
 I am pleased with Mr. Hickman, I can tell you:--for he has sent her
