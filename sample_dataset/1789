and charming.
 I was however too much vexed, disconcerted, mortified, to hinder her from
 retiring.  And yet she had not gone, if Dorcas had not coughed.
 The wench came in, as soon as her lady had retired, and gave me the copy
 she had taken.  And what should it be but of the answer the truly
 admirable creature had intended to give to my written proposals in

 I have but just dipt my pen into this affecting paper.  Were I to read it
 attentively, not a wink should I sleep this night.  To-morrow it shall
 obtain my serious consideration.
 LETTER XLVIII
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
 TUESDAY MORNING, MAY 23.
 The dear creature desires to be excused seeing me till evening.  She is
 not very well, as Dorcas tells me.
 Read here, if thou wilt, the paper transcribed by Dorcas.  It is

 nobly sustained as those she has passed through, to make her (if she
 really hate me not) legally mine.

 with my father.  Time and patience will subdue all things.  My prospects
 of happiness are extremely contracted.  A husband's right will be always
 the same.  In my lifetime I could wish nothing to be done of this sort.
 Your circumstances, Sir, will not oblige you to extort violently from him
