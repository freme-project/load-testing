mother's tenderness--why, Madam, it is for this very reason the girl is
 not admitted into her presence.
 Thus she ran on, as she went downstairs.
 LETTER I
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 My heart fluttered with the hope and the fear of seeing my mother, and
 with the shame and grief of having given her so much uneasiness. But it
 needed not: she was not permitted to come. But my aunt was so good as to
 return, yet not without my sister; and, taking my hand, made me sit down
 by her.
 She came, she must own, officiously, she said, this once more,
 though against the opinion of my father: but knowing and dreading the
 consequence of my opposition, she could not but come.
 She then set forth to my friends' expectation from me; Mr. Solmes's
 riches (three times as rich he came out to be, as any body had thought
 him); the settlements proposed; Mr. Lovelace's bad character; their
 aversions to him; all in a very strong light; not in a stronger than
 my mother had before placed them in. My mother, surely, could not have
 given the particulars of what had passed between herself and me: if she
 had, my aunt would not have repeated many of the same sentiments, as
 you will find she did, that had been still more strongly urged, without
 effect by her venerable sister.
 She said it would break the heart of my father to have it imagined that
 he had not a power over his own child; and that, as he thought, for
 my own good: a child too, whom they had always doated upon!--Dearest,
 dearest Miss, concluded she, clasping her fingers, with the most
 condescending earnestness, let me beg of you, for my sake, for your own
 sake, for a hundred sakes, to get over this averseness, to give up your
 prejudices, and make every one happy and easy once more.--I would kneel
 to you, my dearest Niece--nay, I will kneel to you--!
