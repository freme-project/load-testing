deeper impressions of favour for me in their hearts: but I will love and
 honour them as long as I live.
 All this, Clarissa, makes your prepossession in a certain man's favour
 the more evident. Indeed, your brother and sister cannot go any where,
 but they hear of these prepossessions.
 It is a great grief to me, Madam, to be made the subject of the public
 talk: but I hope you will have the goodness to excuse me for observing,
 that the authors of my disgrace within doors, the talkers of my
 prepossession without, and the reporters of it from abroad, are
 originally the same persons.
 She severely chid me for this.
 I received her rebukes in silence.
 You are sullen, Clarissa: I see you are sullen.--And she walked about
 the room in anger. Then turning to me--You can bear the imputation of
 sullenness I see!--You have no concern to clear yourself of it. I was
 afraid of telling you all I was enjoined to tell you, in case you were
 to be unpersuadable: but I find that I had a greater opinion of
 your delicacy, of your gentleness, than I needed to have--it cannot
 discompose so steady, so inflexible a young creature, to be told, as I
 now tell you, that the settlements are actually drawn; and that you will
 be called down in a very few days to hear them read, and to sign them:
 for it is impossible, if your heart be free, that you can make the least
 objection to them; except it will be an objection with you, that they
 are so much in your favour, and in the favour of all our family.
 I was speechless, absolutely speechless. Although my heart was ready to
 burst, yet could I neither weep nor speak.
 I am sorry, said she, for your averseness to this match: [match she was
 pleased to call it!] but there is no help. The honour and interest
 of the family, as your aunt has told you, and as I have told you, are
 concerned; and you must comply.
