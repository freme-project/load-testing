 Forbid it, Gratitude! Forbid it, Justice! that any woman of sense should
 give occasion to have this said of her!
 Did I think you would have any manner of doubt, from the style or
 contents of this letter, whose saucy pen it is that has run on at this
 rate, I would write my name at length; since it comes too much from my
 heart to disavow it: but at present the initials shall serve; and I will
 go on again directly.

 They began to talk of Mr. Lovelace of their own accord; and upon some
 gentlemen in the room asking, when they expected him in town, answered,

 said, he had indeed heard, that Mr. Lovelace was a very fine
 gentleman--and was proceeding, when one of them, interrupting him,
 said,--Only, Sir, the finest gentleman in the world; that's all.
 And so he led them on to expatiate more particularly on his qualities;
 which they were very fond of doing: but said not one single word in
