usage I have met with?
 And you, Sir, turning to my brother, if you think that meekness always
 indicates tameness; and that there is no magnanimity without bluster;
 own yourself mistaken for once: for you shall have reason to judge from
 henceforth, that a generous mind is not to be forced; and that--
 No more, said the imperious wretch, I charge you, lifting up his hands
 and eyes. Then turning to my uncle, Do you hear, Sir? this is your once
 faultless niece! This is your favourite!
 Mr. Solmes looked as if he know not what to think of the matter; and had
 I been left alone with him, I saw plainly I could have got rid of him
 easily enough.
 My uncle came to me, looking up also to my face, and down to my feet:
 and is it possible this can be you? All this violence from you, Miss
 Clary?
 Yes, it is possible, Sir--and, I will presume to say, this vehemence on
 my side is but the natural consequence of the usage I have met with, and
 the rudeness I am treated with, even in your presence, by a brother, who
 has no more right to controul me, than I have to controul him.
 This usage, cousin Clary, was not till all other means were tried with
 you.
 Tried! to what end, Sir?--Do I contend for any thing more than a mere
 negative? You may, Sir, [turning to Mr. Solmes,] possibly you may be
 induced the rather to persevere thus ungenerously, as the usage I have
 met with for your sake, and what you have now seen offered to me by my
 brother, will shew you what I can bear, were my evil destiny ever to
 make me yours.
 Lord, Madam, cried Solmes, [all this time distorted into twenty
 different attitudes, as my brother and my uncle were blessing
 themselves, and speaking only to each other by their eyes, and by their
 working features; Lord, Madam,] what a construction is this!
