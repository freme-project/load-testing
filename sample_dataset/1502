was never to return alive, the Ides of March are come. But they are not

 You have my prayers.
 My Dolly knows not that I write: nobody does*; not even Mr. Hervey.
      * Notwithstanding what Mrs. Hervey here says, it will be hereafter seen

 your's, my dear, must be alarming to all parents,) she has been
 forbidden, on pain of losing our favour for ever: and this at your
 family's request, as well as by her father's commands.
 You have the poor girl's hourly prayers, I will, however, tell you,
 though she knows not what I do, as well as those of
 Your truly afflicted aunt, D. HERVEY.
