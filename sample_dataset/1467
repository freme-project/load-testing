said, was now the subject of our deliberation.
 I was forced to hear him.
 You condescended, dearest creature, said he, to ask my advice. It was
 very easy, give me leave to say, to advise you what to do. I hope I may,
 on this new occasion, speak without offence, notwithstanding your former
 injunctions--You see that there can be no hope of reconciliation with
 your relations. Can you, Madam, consent to honour with your hand a
 wretch whom you have never yet obliged with one voluntary favour!
 What a recriminating, what a reproachful way, my dear, was this, of
 putting a question of this nature!
 I expected not from him, at the time, and just as I was very angry with
 him, either the question or the manner. I am ashamed to recollect the
 confusion I was thrown into; all your advice in my head at the moment:
 yet his words so prohibitory. He confidently seemed to enjoy my
 confusion [indeed, my dear, he knows not what respectful love is!] and
 gazed upon me, as if he would have looked me through.
 He was still more declarative afterwards, as I shall mention by-and-by:
 but it was half extorted from him.
 My heart struggled violently between resentment and shame, to be thus
 teased by one who seemed to have all his passions at command, at a time
 when I had very little over mine! till at last I burst into tears, and
 was going from him in high disgust: when, throwing his arms about me,
 with an air, however, the most tenderly respectful, he gave a stupid
 turn to the subject.
 It was far from his heart, he said, to take so much advantage of the
 streight, which the discovery of my brother's foolish project had
 brought me into, as to renew, without my permission, a proposal which I
 had hitherto discountenanced, and which for that reason--
 And then he came with his half-sentences, apologizing for what he had
 not so much as half-proposed.
