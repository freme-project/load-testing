unbusy.
 I believe it was a quarter of an hour before she spoke to me (my heart
 throbbing with the suspense all the time); and then she asked me coldly,
 What directions I had given for the day?
 I shewed her the bill of fare for this day, and to-morrow, if, I said,
 it pleased her to approve of it.
 She made a small alteration in it; but with an air so cold and so
 solemn, as added to my emotions.
 Mr. Harlowe talks of dining out to-day, I think, at my brother
 Antony's--
 Mr. Harlowe!--Not my father!--Have I not then a father!--thought I.
 Sit down when I bid you.
 I sat down.
 You look very sullen, Clary.
 I hope not, Madam.
 If children would always be children--parents--And there she stopt.
 She then went to her toilette, and looked into the glass, and gave half
 a sigh--the other half, as if she would not have sighed if she could
 have helped it, she gently hem'd away.
 I don't love to see the girl look so sullen.
 Indeed, Madam, I am not sullen.--And I arose, and, turning from her,
 drew out my handkerchief; for the tears ran down my cheeks.
 I thought, by the glass before me, I saw the mother in her softened eye
 cast towards me. But her words confirmed not the hoped-for tenderness.
 One of the most provoking things in this world is, to have people cry
 for what they can help!
 I wish to heaven I could, Madam!--And I sobbed again.
 Tears of penitence and sobs of perverseness are mighty well suited!--You
 may go up to your chamber. I shall talk with you by-and-by.
 I courtesied with reverence.
