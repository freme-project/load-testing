manage their future offspring, how few people would have children!
 James and Arabella may have their motives; but what can be said for a
 father acting as this father has acted? What for a mother? What for
 an aunt? What for uncles?--Who can have patience with such fellows and
 fellowesses?
 Soon will the fair one hear how high their foolish resentments run
 against her: and then will she, it is to be hoped, have a little more
 confidence in me. Then will I be jealous that she loves me not with the
 preference my heart builds upon: then will I bring her to confessions
 of grateful love: and then will I kiss her when I please; and not stand
 trembling, as now, like a hungry hound, who sees a delicious morsel
 within his reach, (the froth hanging upon his vermilion jaws,) yet dares
 not leap at it for his life.
 But I was originally a bashful mortal. Indeed I am bashful still with
 regard to this lady--Bashful, yet know the sex so well!--But that indeed
 is the reason that I know it so well:--For, Jack, I have had abundant
 cause, when I have looked into myself, by way of comparison with the
 other sex, to conclude that a bashful man has a good deal of the soul of
 a woman; and so, like Tiresias, can tell what they think, and what they
 drive at, as well as themselves.
 The modest ones and I, particularly, are pretty much upon a par. The
 difference between us is only, what they think, I act. But the immodest
 ones out-do the worst of us by a bar's length, both in thinking and
 acting.
 One argument let me plead in proof of my assertion; That even we rakes
 love modesty in a woman; while the modest woman, as they are accounted,
 (that is to say, the slyest,) love, and generally prefer, an impudent
 man. Whence can this be, but from a likeness in nature? And this made
 the poet say, That ever woman is a rake in her heart. It concerns them,
 by their actions, to prove the contrary, if they can.
