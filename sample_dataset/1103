treatment, that I never found myself so much disconcerted, and out of my
 train.
 But I was to be more so. This was to be a day of puzzle to me. Pregnant
 puzzle, if I may say so: for there must great meaning lie behind it.
 In the afternoon, all but my brother and sister went to church with
 the good doctor; who left his compliments for me. I took a walk in the
 garden. My brother and sister walked in it too, and kept me in their
 eye a good while, on purpose, as I thought, that I might see how gay and
 good-humoured they were together. At last they came down the walk that I
 was coming up, hand-in-hand, lover-like.
 Your servant, Miss--your servant, Sir--passed between my brother and me.
 Is it not coldish, Clary! in a kinder voice than usual, said my sister,
 and stopped.--I stopped and courtesied low to her half-courtesy.--I
 think not, Sister, said I.
 She went on. I courtesied without return; and proceeded, turning to my
 poultry-yard.
 By a shorter turn, arm-in-arm, they were there before me.
 I think, Clary, said my brother, you must present me with some of this
 breed, for Scotland.
 If you please, Brother.
 I'll choose for you, said my sister.
 And while I fed them, they pointed to half a dozen: yet intending
 nothing by it, I believe, but to shew a deal of love and good-humour to
 each other before me.
 My uncles next, (at their return from church) were to do me the honour
 of their notice. They bid Betty tell me, they would drink tea with me
 in my own apartment. Now, thought I, shall I have the subject of next
 Tuesday enforced upon me.
 But they contradicted the order for tea, and only my uncle Harlowe came
 up to me.
