deliver so harsh a declaration; being still in hope that you would come
 down to us in a compliant temper. Hannah has overheard this, I suppose;
 and has told you of it; as also, that he declared he would break your
 heart, rather than you should break his. And I now assure you, that you
 will be confined, and prohibited making teasing appeals to any of us:
 and we shall see who is to submit, you to us, or every body to you.
 Again I offered to clear Hannah, and to lay the latter part of the
 intelligence to my sister's echo, Betty Barnes, who had boasted of it to
 another servant: but I was again bid to be silent on that head. I
 should soon find, my mother was pleased to say, that others could be as
 determined as I was obstinate: and once for all would add, that since
 she saw that I built upon her indulgence, and was indifferent about
 involving her in contentions with my father, she would now assure me,
 that she was as much determined against Mr. Lovelace, and for Mr. Solmes
 and the family schemes, as any body; and would not refuse her consent to
 any measures that should be thought necessary to reduce a stubborn child
 to her duty.
 I was ready to sink. She was so good as to lend me her arm to support
 And this, said I, is all I have to hope for from my Mamma?
 It is. But, Clary, this one further opportunity I give you--Go in again
 to Mr. Solmes, and behave discreetly to him; and let your father find
 you together, upon civil terms at least.
 My feet moved [of themselves, I think] farther from the parlour where he
 was, and towards the stairs; and there I stopped and paused.
 If, proceeded she, you are determined to stand in defiance of us
 all--then indeed you may go up to your chamber (as you are ready to
 do)--And God help you!
 God help me, indeed! for I cannot give hope of what I cannot intend--But
 let me have your prayers, my dear Mamma!--Those shall have mine, who
 have brought me into all this distress.
