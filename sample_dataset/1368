Except the forest, replied he, where I have often hunted, I know the
 least of Windsor of any place so noted and so pleasant. Indeed I have
 not a single acquaintance there.
 Upon the whole, I told him, that I thought his proposal of Windsor, not
 amiss; and that I would remove thither, if I could get a lodging only
 for myself, and an upper chamber for Hannah; for that my stock of money
 was but small, as was easy to be conceived and I should be very loth to
 be obliged to any body. I added, that the sooner I removed the better;
 for that then he could have no objection to go to London, or Berkshire,
 as he pleased: and I should let every body know my independence.
 He again proposed himself, in very polite terms, for my banker. But I,
 as civilly, declined his offer.
 This conversation was to be, all of it, in the main, agreeable. He asked
 whether I would choose to lodge in the town of Windsor, or out of it?
 As near the castle, I said, as possible, for the convenience of going
 constantly to the public worship; an opportunity I had been very long
 deprived of.
 He should be very glad, he told me, if he could procure me
 accommodations in any one of the canon's houses; which he imagined would
 be more agreeable to me than any other, on many accounts. And as he
 could depend upon my promise, Never to have any other man but himself,
 on the condition to which he had so cheerfully subscribed, he should be
 easy; since it was now his part, in earnest, to set about recommending
 himself to my favour, by the only way he knew it would be done. Adding,
 with a very serious air--I am but a young man, Madam; but I have run a
 long course: let not your purity of mind incline you to despise me for
 the acknowledgement. It is high time to be weary of it, and to reform;
 since, like Solomon, I can say, There is nothing new under the sun: but
 that it is my belief, that a life of virtue can afford such pleasures,
 on reflection, as will be for ever blooming, for ever new!
