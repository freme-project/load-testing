your enterprise) in procuring you a vehicle. Had you not obliged me to
 keep measures with my mother, I could have managed it with ease. I could
 even have taken our own chariot, on one pretence or other, and put two
 horses extraordinary to it, if I had thought fit; and I could, when we
 had got to London, have sent it back, and nobody the wiser as to the
 lodgings we might have taken.
 I wish to the Lord you had permitted this. Indeed I think you are too
 punctilious a great deal for you situation. Would you expect to enjoy
 yourself with your usual placidness, and not to be ruffled, in an
 hurricane which every moment threatens to blow your house down?
 Had your distress sprung from yourself, that would have been another
 thing. But when all the world knows where to lay the fault, this alters
 the case.
 How can you say I am happy, when my mother, to her power, is as much an
 abettor of their wickedness to my dearest friend, as your aunt, or any
 body else?--and this through the instigation of that odd-headed and
 foolish uncle of yours, who [sorry creature that he is!] keeps her up
 to resolutions which are unworthy of her, for an example to me, if it
 please you. Is not this cause enough for me to ground a resentment upon,
 sufficient to justify me for accompanying you; the friendship between us
 so well known?
 Indeed, my dear, the importance of the case considered, I must repeat,
 that you are too nice. Don't they already think that your non-compliance
 with their odious measures is owing a good deal to my advice? Have they
 not prohibited our correspondence upon that very surmise? And have I,
 but on your account, reason to value what they think?
 Besides, What discredit have I to fear by such a step? What detriment?
 Would Hickman, do you believe, refuse me upon it?--If he did, should
 I be sorry for that?--Who is it, that has a soul, who would not be
 affected by such an instance of female friendship?
