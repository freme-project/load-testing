 compare notes with: any body to alarm her: and I may be saved the guilt
 and disobligation of inspecting into a correspondence that has long made
 me uneasy.
 How every thing works for me!--Why will this charming creature make such
 contrivances necessary, as will increase my trouble, and my guilt too, as
 some will account it?  But why, rather I should ask, will she fight
 against her stars?

 particularly; and then I had not seen her: but now, I join her sake,
 honour's sake, motives of justice, generosity, gratitude, and humanity,
 which are all concerned in the preservation of so fine a woman.  Thou
 knowest not the anguish I should have had, (whence arising, I cannot
