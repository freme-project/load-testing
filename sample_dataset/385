Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting
 his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
 "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a
 sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his
 way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
 that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
 it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,
 which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other
 hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
 felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
 entirely lost his self-respect."
 "Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
 "The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
 grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
 lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
 lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
 hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all
 appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of
 lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey
 dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
 showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while
 the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
 wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in
 the best of training."
 "But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
 "This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
 Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
 when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear
 that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
 affection."
