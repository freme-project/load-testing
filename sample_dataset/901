'That the adversary only held the sword: he himself pointed it to his
 breast:--And why should he mortally resent that malice, which he might
 be the better for as long as he lived?'--What could be the reading
 he has been said to be master of, to wonder, as he did, at these
 observations?
 But, indeed, he must take pleasure in revenge; and yet holds others to
 be inexcusable for the same fault. He is not, however, the only one
 who can see how truly blamable those errors are in another, which they
 hardly think such in themselves.
 From these considerations, from these over-balances, it was, that I
 said, in a former, that I would not be in love with this man for the
 world: and it was going further than prudence would warrant, when I was
 for compounding with you, by the words conditional liking, which you so
 humourously rally.
 Well but, methinks you say, what is all this to the purpose? This is
 still but reasoning: but, if you are in love, you are: and love,
 like the vapours, is the deeper rooted for having no sufficient cause
 assignable for its hold. And so you call upon me again to have no
 reserves, and so-forth.
 Why then, my dear, if you will have it, I think, that, with all his
 preponderating faults, I like him better than I ever thought I should
 like him; and, those faults considered, better perhaps than I ought to
 like him. And I believe, it is possible for the persecution I labour
 under to induce me to like him still more--especially while I can
 recollect to his advantage our last interview, and as every day produces
 stronger instances of tyranny, I will call it, on the other side.--In
 a word, I will frankly own (since you cannot think any thing I say too
 explicit) that were he now but a moral man, I would prefer him to all
 the men I ever saw.
 So that this is but conditional liking still, you'll say: nor, I hope,
