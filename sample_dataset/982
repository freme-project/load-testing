me see, if this favour be permitted. Favour I call it, and am ready to
 receive and acknowledge it as such, although my grandfather's will has
 made it a matter of right.
 You ask me, in a very unbrotherly manner, in the postscript to your
 letter, if I have not some new proposals to make? I HAVE (since you put
 the question) three or four; new ones all, I think; though I will be
 bold to say, that, submitting the case to any one person whom you have

 house, I beg I may be suffered to go to my aunt Hervey's, where I will
 inviolably observe her commands, and those of my father and mother.
 But if this, neither, is to be granted, it is my humble request, that I
 may be sent to my uncle Harlowe's, instead of my uncle Antony's. I mean
 not by this any disrespect to my uncle Antony: but his moat, with his
 bridge threatened to be drawn up, and perhaps the chapel there, terrify
 me beyond expression, notwithstanding your witty ridicule upon me for
