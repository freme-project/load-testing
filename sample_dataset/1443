But here is the thing: there is not a better manager of affairs in the
 sex than my mother; and I believe a notable wife is more impatient of
 controul than an indolent one. An indolent one, perhaps, thinks she
 has some thing to compound for; while women of the other character, I
 suppose, know too well their own significance to think highly of that of
 any body else. All must be their own way. In one word, because they are
 useful, they will be more than useful.
 I do assure you, my dear, were I man, and a man who loved my quiet, I

 qualifications, if I heard she was notable, were masculine or feminine
 ones. If indeed I were an indolent supine mortal, who might be in danger

 known.
 Indeed, my dear, I do not think a man-woman a pretty character at all:
 and, as I said, were I a man, I would sooner choose a dove, though it
 were fit for nothing but, as the play says, to go tame about house,
 and breed, than a wife that is setting at work (my insignificant self
 present perhaps) every busy our my never-resting servants, those of
 the stud not excepted; and who, with a besom in her hand, as I may say,
 would be continually filling my with apprehensions that she wanted to
 sweep me out of my own house as useless lumber.
 Were indeed the mistress of a family (like the wonderful young lady I so
 much and so justly admire) to know how to confine herself within her own
 respectable rounds of the needle, the pen, the housekeeper's bills, the
