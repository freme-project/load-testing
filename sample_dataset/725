against me. Upon some fresh provocation, or new intelligence concerning
 Mr. Lovelace, (I know not what it is,) they have bound themselves, or
 are to bind themselves, by a signed paper, to one another [The Lord
 bless me, my dear, what shall I do!] to carry their point in favour of
 Mr. Solmes, in support of my father's authority, as it is called, and
 against Mr. Lovelace, as a libertine, and an enemy to the family: and if
 so, I am sure, I may say against me.--How impolitic in them all, to join
 two people in one interest, whom they wish for ever to keep asunder!
 What the discharged steward reported of him is surely bad enough: what
 Mrs. Fortescue said, not only confirms that bad, but gives room to think
 him still worse. And yet the something further which my friends have
 come at, is of so heinous a nature (as Betty Barnes tells Hannah) that
 it proves him almost to be the worst of men.--But, hang the man, I
 had almost said--What is he to me? What would he be--were not this Mr.
 Sol----O my dear, how I hate the man in the light he is proposed to me!
 All of them, at the same time, are afraid of Mr. Lovelace; yet not
 afraid to provoke him!--How am I entangled!--to be obliged to go on
 corresponding with him for their sakes--Heaven forbid, that their
 persisted-in violence should so drive me, as to make it necessary for my
 own!
 But surely they will yield--Indeed I cannot.
 I believe the gentlest spirits when provoked (causelessly and cruelly
 provoked) are the most determined. The reason may be, that not taking
 up resolutions lightly--their very deliberation makes them the more
 immovable.--And then when a point is clear and self-evident, how can
 one with patience think of entering into an argument or contention upon
 it?--
 An interruption obliges me to conclude myself, in some hurry, as well as
 fright, what I must ever be,
 Yours more than my own, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
