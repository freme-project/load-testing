 will not go at all.
 But after such generous motions from him, I really think it a little

 upon. And I have no reason to expect a miracle in my favour.
 Well, Sir, said I, [rising to leave him,] something must be resolved
 upon: but I will postpone this subject till to-morrow morning.
 He would fain have engaged me longer: but I said I would see him as
 early as he pleased in the morning. He might think of any convenient
 place in London, or near it, in mean time.
 And so I retired from him. As I do from my pen; hoping for better rest
 for the few hours that remain of this night than I have had of a long
 time.

 I think you mentioned one to me, Sir--Did you not?
 Yes, Madam, [but, watching the turn of my countenance,] rather as what
