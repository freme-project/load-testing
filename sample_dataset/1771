specious veil of humility, doubling the merit to myself by the supposed,
 and indeed imputed, gracefulness in the manner of conferring benefits,
 when I had not a single merit in what I did, vastly overpaid by the
 pleasure of doing some little good, and impelled, as I may say, by
 talents given me--for what!--Not to be proud of.
 So, desirous, in short, to be considered as an example!  A vanity which

 And whom have I to raise me up, whom to comfort me, if I desert myself?--
 Thou, O Father, who, I hope, hast not yet deserted, hast not yet cursed
