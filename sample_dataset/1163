for her health. 'Let her not inquire after the disorders she occasions,'

 Very, very hard, my dear! Indeed it is very hard.

 I have the pleasure to hear that my mother is already better. A colicky
 disorder, to which she is too subject. It is hoped it is gone off--God
 send it may!--Every evil that happens in this house is owing to me!
 This good news was told me, with a circumstance very unacceptable; for
 Betty said, she had orders to let me know, that my garden-walks and
 poultry-visits were suspected; and that both will be prohibited, if I
 stay here till Saturday or Monday.
 Possibly this is said by order, to make me go with less reluctance to my

 my pen and ink, 'that reading was more to the purpose, at present, than
 writing: that by the one, I might be taught my duty; that the other,
 considering whom I was believed to write to, only stiffened my will:
 that my needle-works had better be pursued than my airings; which were
 observed to be taken in all weathers.'
 So, my dear, if I do not resolve upon something soon, I shall neither be
 able to avoid the intended evil, nor have it in my power to correspond
 with you.

 I will go down, though 'tis almost dark, on pretence of getting a little
