condescend to see me?
 Yes, if you can be dutiful at last.
 I can. I will.
 But what call you dutiful?
 To give up my own inclinations--That's something more for you to tell
 of--in obedience to my parents' commands; and to beg that I may not be
 made miserable with a man that is fitter for any body than for me.
 For me, do you mean, Clary?
 Why not? since you have put the question. You have a better opinion of
 him than I have. My friends, I hope, would not think him too good for
 me, and not good enough for you. But cannot you tell me, Bella, what
 is to become of me, without insulting over me thus?--If I must be thus
 treated, remember, that if I am guilty of any rashness, the usage I meet
 with will justify it.
 So, Clary, you are contriving an excuse, I find, for somewhat that we
 have not doubted has been in your head a great while.
 If it were so, you seem resolved, for your part, and so does my brother
 for his, that I shall not want one.--But indeed, Bella, I can bear no
 longer this repetition of the worst part of yesterday's conversation:
 I desire I may throw myself at my father's and mother's feet, and hear
 from them what their sentence is. I shall at least avoid, by that means,
 the unsisterly insults I meet with from you.
 Hey-day! What, is this you? Is it you, my meek sister Clary?
 Yes, it is I, Bella; and I will claim the protection due to a child of
 the family, or to know why I am to be thus treated, when I offer only to
 preserve to myself the liberty of refusal, which belongs to my sex; and,
 to please my parents, would give up my choice. I have contented myself
 till now to take second-hand messengers, and first-hand insults: you are
 but my sister: my brother is not my sovereign. And while I have a father
 and mother living, I will not be thus treated by a brother and sister,
