one of the sex ever before could give such an example of--I would not,
 I say; and yet, for such a trial of you to yourself, rather than as an
 impertinent overflow of raillery in your friend, as money-takers try a
 suspected guinea by the sound, let me on such a supposition, sound you,
 by repeating, poor Mr. Lovelace!
 And now, my dear, how is it with you? How do you now, as my mother says
 to Mr. Hickman, when her pert daughter has made him look sorrowful?
 LETTER XXII
 MR. HICKMAN, TO MRS. HOWE WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29.
 MADAM,
 It is with infinite regret that I think myself obliged, by pen and ink,
 to repeat my apprehension, that it is impossible for me ever to obtain a
 share in the affections of your beloved daughter. O that it were not too
 evident to every one, as well as to myself, even to our very servants,
 that my love for her, and my assiduities, expose me rather to her scorn
 [forgive me, Madam, the hard word!] than to the treatment due to a man
 whose proposals have met with your approbation, and who loves her above
 all the women in the world!
 Well might the merit of my passion be doubted, if, like Mr. Solmes to
 the truly-admirably Miss Clarissa Harlowe, I could continue my addresses
 to Miss Howe's distaste. Yet what will not the discontinuance cost me!
 Give me leave, nevertheless, dearest, worthiest Lady, to repeat, what I
 told you, on Monday night, at Mrs. Larkin's, with a heart even bursting
 with grief, That I wanted not the treatment of that day to convince
 me, that I am not, nor ever can be, the object of Miss Howe's voluntary
 favour. What hopes can there be, that a lady will ever esteem, as a
 husband, the man, whom, as a lover, she despises? Will not every act
 of obligingness from such a one, be construed as an unmanly tameness
 of spirit, and entitle him the more to her disdain?--My heart is full:
 Forgive me, if I say, that Miss Howe's treatment of me does no credit
