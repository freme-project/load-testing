of name!
 But if she resist--if nobly she stand her trial?--
 Why then I will marry her; and bless my starts for such an angel of a
 wife.
 But will she not hate thee?--will she not refuse--
 No, no, Jack!--Circumstanced and situated as we are, I am not afraid of
 that. And hate me! Why should she hate the man who loves her upon proof?
 And then for a little hint at reprisal--am I not justified in my
 resolutions of trying her virtue, who is resolved, as I may say, to try
 mine? Who has declared that she will not marry me, till she has hopes of
 my reformation?
 And now, to put an end to this sober argumentation, Wilt thou not
 thyself (whom I have supposed an advocate for the lady, because I know
 that Lord M. has put thee upon using the interest he thinks thou hast in
 me, to persuade me to enter the pale; wilt thou not thyself) allow me to
 try if I cannot awaken the woman in her?--To try if she, with all that
 glowing symmetry of parts, and that full bloom of vernal graces, by
 which she attracts every eye, be really inflexible as to the grand
 article?
 Let me begin then, as opportunity presents--I will; and watch her
 every step to find one sliding one; her every moment to find the
 moment critical. And the rather, as she spares me not, but takes every
 advantage that offers to puzzle and plague me; nor expect nor thinks me
 to be a good man.
 If she be a woman, and love me, I shall surely catch her once tripping:
 for love was ever a traitor to its harbourer: and love within, and I
 without, she will be more than woman, as the poet says, or I less than
 man, if I succeed not.
 Now, Belford, all is out. The lady is mine; shall be more mine.
 Marriage, I see, is in my power, now she is so. Else perhaps it had not.
