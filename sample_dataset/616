 "Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just
 as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and
 drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he
 said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,
 for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all
 stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds
 round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
 slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about
 a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs
 to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord
 Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in
 front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
 
 "I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,
 and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
 There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to
 us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is
 not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much
 younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,
 while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
 conversation I have gathered that they have been married about
 seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by
 the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.
 Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
 was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As
 the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite
 imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
 father's young wife.
