humour.  Dorcas says, not with me neither, she believes: but something
 has vexed him.  This is perhaps to make me dine with him.  But I will
 not, if I can help it.  I shan't get rid of him for the rest of the day,
 if I do.
 He was very earnest to dine with me.  But I was resolved to carry this
 one small point; and so denied to dine myself.  And indeed I was
 endeavouring to write to my cousin Morden; and had begun three different
 times, without being able to please myself.
 He was very busy in writing, Dorcas says; and pursued it without dining,
 because I denied him my company.
 He afterwards demanded, as I may say, to be admitted to afternoon-tea with
 me: and appealed by Dorcas to his behaviour to me last night; as if I
 sent him word by her, he thought he had a merit in being unexceptionable.
 However, I repeated my promise to meet him as early as he pleased in the
 morning, or to breakfast with him.
 Dorcas says, he raved: I heard him loud, and I heard his servant fly from
 him, as I thought.  You, my dearest friend, say, in one of yours,* that
 you must have somebody to be angry at, when your mother sets you up.  I
 should be very loth to draw comparisons; but the workings of passion,
 when indulged, are but too much alike, whether in man or woman.
 * See Letter X. of this volume, Parag. 2.
 He has just sent me word, that he insists upon supping with me.  As we
 had been in a good train for several days past, I thought it not prudent
 to break with him for little matters.  Yet, to be, in a manner,
 threatened into his will, I know not how to bear that.
 While I was considering, he came up, and, tapping at my door, told me, in
 a very angry tone, he must see me this night.  He could not rest, till he
 had been told what he had done to deserve the treatment I gave him.
 Treatment I gave him! a wretch!  Yet perhaps he has nothing new to say to
 me.  I shall be very angry with him.
