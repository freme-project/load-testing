 no-wife. When I reform, I'll marry. 'Tis time enough for the one, the
 lady must say--for the other, say I!
 But how I ramble!--This is to be in such a situation, that I know not
 what to resolve upon.

 tell thee: but being got too far from the track I set out in, I will
 close here. I may, however, write every day something, and send it as
 opportunity offers.
 Regardless, nevertheless, I shall be in all I write, of connection,
 accuracy, or of any thing but of my own imperial will and pleasure.
