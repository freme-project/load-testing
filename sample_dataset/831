 own wires?
 This it is that makes my pride mount above my resentment. By this
 engine, whose springs I am continually oiling, I play them all off.
 The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella
 Howe, to engage her (for example-sake to her princessly daughter) to
 join in their cause, and to assert an authority they are resolved, right

 But here's her mistake; nor will she be cured of it--She takes the man
