to my sex--while that avowed love, however indiscreetly shown, which is
 followed by marriage, will find more excuses made for it, than generally
 it ought to find.
 But, if your mother will receive the communication in confidence, pray
 shew her all that I have written, or shall write. If my past conduct
 in that case shall not be found to deserve heavy blame, I shall then
 perhaps have the benefit of her advice, as well as yours. And if, after
