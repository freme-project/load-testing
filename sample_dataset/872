justify me for an aversion to a man whom every body thought utterly
 unworthy of me, and more fit for my sister: that unhappy as he was,
 in not having been able to make any greater impression upon me in his
 favour, all the world gave me to him. Nor was there but one objection
 made to him by his very enemies (his birth, his prospects all very
 unexceptionable, and the latter splendid); and that objection, he
 thanked God, and my example, was in a fair way of being removed for
 ever: since he had seen his error, and was heartily sick of the courses
 he had followed; which, however, were far less enormous than malice and
 envy had represented them to be. But of this he should say the less, as
 it were much better to justify himself by his actions, than by the most
 solemn asseverations and promises. And then, complimenting my person,
 he assured me (for that he always loved virtue, although he had not
 followed its rules as he ought) that he was still more captivated with
 the graces of my mind: and would frankly own, that till he had the
 honour to know me, he had never met with an inducement sufficient to
 enable him to overcome an unhappy kind of prejudice to matrimony; which
 had made him before impenetrable to the wishes and recommendations of
 all his relations.
 You see, my dear, he scruples not to speak of himself, as his enemies
 speak of him. I can't say, but his openness in these particulars gives
 a credit to his other professions. I should easily, I think, detect
 an hypocrite: and this man particularly, who is said to have allowed
 himself in great liberties, were he to pretend to instantaneous lights
 and convictions--at this time of life too. Habits, I am sensible, are
 not so easily changed. You have always joined with me in remarking, that
 he will speak his mind with freedom, even to a degree of unpoliteness
 sometimes; and that his very treatment of my family is a proof that he
 cannot make a mean court to any body for interest sake--What pity, where
 there are such laudable traces, that they should have been so mired, and
