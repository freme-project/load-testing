weeps her vitals away, while she but involuntary curls about him; how
 shall I be able to bear that?
 May Heaven restore my charmer to health and spirits, I hourly pray--that
 a man may see whether she can love any body but her father and mother!
 In their power, I am confident, it will be, at any time, to make her
 husband joyless; and that, as I hate them so heartily, is a shocking
