him, for his condescension; that was the brutal brother's word!
 He had led me up to meet Mr. Solmes, whose hand he took, as he held
 mine. Here, Sir, said he, take the rebel daughter's hand: I give it you
 now: she shall confirm the gift in a week's time; or will have neither
 father, mother, nor uncles, to boast of.
 I snatched my hand away.
 How now, Miss--!
 And how now, Sir!--What right have you to dispose of my hand?--If you
 govern every body else, you shall not govern me; especially in a point
 so immediately relative to myself, and in which you neither have, nor
 ever shall have, any thing to do.
 I would have broken from him; but he held my hand too fast.
 Let me go, Sir!--Why am I thus treated?--You design, I doubt not, with
 your unmanly gripings, to hurt me, as you do: But again I ask, wherefore
 is it that I am to be thus treated by you?
 He tossed my hand from him with a whirl, that pained my very shoulder. I
 wept, and held my other hand to the part.
 Mr. Solmes blamed him. So did my uncle.
 He had no patience, he said, with such a perverse one; and to think of
 the reflections upon himself, before he entered. He had only given me
 back the hand I had not deserved he should touch. It was one of my arts
 to pretend to be so pained.
 Mr. Solmes said, he would sooner give up all his hopes of me, than that
 I should be used unkindly.--And he offered to plead in my behalf to them
 both; and applied himself with a bow, as if for my approbation of his
 interposition.
 Interpose not, Mr. Solmes, said I, to save me from my brother's
 violence. I cannot wish to owe an obligation to a man whose ungenerous
 perseverance is the occasion of that violence, and of all my disgraceful
 sufferings.
