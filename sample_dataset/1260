that as it will, I must say, that the best of him, and of my prospects
 with him, are bad; and yet, having enrolled myself among the too-late
 repenters, who shall pity me?
 Nevertheless, I will dare to hope for a continued interest in your
 affections [I shall be miserable indeed if I may not!] and to be
 remembered in your daily prayers. For neither time nor accident shall
 ever make me cease to be
 Your faithful and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.
 LETTER III
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOSEPH LEMAN SAT. APRIL 8.
 HONEST JOSEPH,
 At length your beloved young lady has consented to free herself from
 the cruel treatment she has so long borne. She is to meet me without the
 garden-door at about four o'clock on Monday afternoon. I told you she
 had promised to do so. She has confirmed her promise. Thank Heaven she
 has confirmed her promise!
 I shall have a chariot-and-six ready in the by-road fronting the private
 path to Harlowe-paddock; and several of my friends and servants not far
 off, armed to protect her, if there be occasion: but every one charged
 to avoid mischief. That, you know, has always been my principal care.
 All my fear is, that, when she comes to the point, the over-niceness of
 her principles will make her waver, and want to go back: although her
 honour is my honour, you know, and mine is her's. If she should, and
 should I be unable to prevail upon her, all your past services will
 avail nothing, and she will be lost to me for ever: the prey then of
 that cursed Solmes, whose vile stinginess will never permit him to do
 good to any of the servants of the family.
 I have no doubt of your fidelity, honest Joseph; nor of your zeal to
 serve an injured gentleman, and an oppressed young lady. You see by the
 confidence I repose in you, that I have not; more particularly, on this
