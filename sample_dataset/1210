But I should vex and disorder my mother!--Well, that is something: but
 not more than she vexes and disorders me, on her being made an implement
 by such a sorry creature, who ambles hither every day in spite to my
 dearest friend--Woe be to both, if it be for a double end!--Chide me, if
 you will: I don't care.
 I say, and I insist upon it, such a step would ennoble your friend: and
 if still you will permit it, I will take the office out of Lovelace's
 hands; and, to-morrow evening, or on Monday before his time of
 appointment takes place, will come in a chariot, or chaise: and then,
 my dear, if we get off as I wish, will we make terms (and what terms we
 please) with them all. My mother will be glad to receive her daughter
 again, I warrant: and Hickman will cry for joy on my return; or he shall
 for sorrow.
 But you are so very earnestly angry with me for proposing such a step,
 and have always so much to say for your side of any question, that I am
 afraid to urge it farther.--Only be so good (let me add) as to encourage
 me to resume it, if, upon farther consideration, and upon weighing
 matters well, (and in this light, whether best to go off with me,
 or with Lovelace,) you can get over your punctilious regard for my
 reputation. A woman going away with a woman is not so discreditable a
 thing, surely! and with no view, but to avoid the fellows!--I say, only
 to be so good, as to consider this point; and if you can get over your
 scruples on my account, do. And so I will have done with this argument
 for the present; and apply myself to some of the passages in yours.
 A time, I hope, will come, that I shall be able to read your affecting
 narratives without the impatient bitterness which now boils over in my
 heart, and would flow to my pen, were I to enter into the particulars of
 what you write. And indeed I am afraid of giving you my advice at all,
 or telling you what I should do in your case (supposing you will still
 refuse my offer; finding too what you have been brought or rather driven
