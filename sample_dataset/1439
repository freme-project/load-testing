part of my plot. When a general must regulate himself by the motions of
 a watchful adversary, how can he say beforehand what he will, or what he
 will not, do?
 Widow SINCLAIR, didst thou not say, Lovelace?--
 Ay, SINCLAIR, Jack!--Remember the name! SINCLAIR, I repeat. She has no
 other. And her features being broad and full-blown, I will suppose her
 to be of Highland extraction; as her husband the colonel [mind that too]
 was a Scot, as brave, as honest.
 I never forget the minutiae in my contrivances. In all matters that
 admit of doubt, the minutiae, closely attended to and provided for, are
 of more service than a thousand oaths, vows, and protestations made to
 supply the neglect of them, especially when jealousy has made its way in
 the working mind.
 Thou wouldst wonder if thou knewest one half of my providences. To give
 thee but one--I have already been so good as to send up a list of books
 to be procured for the lady's closet, mostly at second hand. And
 thou knowest that the women there are all well read. But I will not
 anticipate--Besides, it looks as if I were afraid of leaving any thing
 to my old friend CHANCE; which has many a time been an excellent second
 to me, and ought not be affronted or despised; especially by one who has
 the art of making unpromising incidents turn out in his favour.
 LETTER XL
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19.
 I have a piece of intelligence to give you, which concerns you much to
 know.
 Your brother having been assured that you are not married, has taken a
 resolution to find you out, waylay you, and carry you off. A friend of
 his, a captain of a ship, undertakes to get you on ship-board, and to
 sail away with you, either to Hull or Leith, in the way to one of your
 brother's houses.
