attempted: [Priscilla Partington for that!]  What! wouldst thou not have
 me act in character?
 But why callest thou the lady innocent?  And why sayest thou she loves
 By innocent, with regard to me, and not taken as a general character, I
 must insist upon it she is not innocent.  Can she be innocent, who, by

 And now imagine (the charmer overcome) thou seest me sitting supinely
 cross-kneed, reclining on my sofa, the god of love dancing in my eyes,
 and rejoicing in every mantling feature; the sweet rogue, late such a
