indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a
 test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came
 down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,
 and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
 "Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back
 to his chemical studies.
 The summons was a brief and urgent one.
 "Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday
 to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."
 "Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
 "I should wish to."
 "Just look it up, then."
 "There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my
 Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
 "That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
 analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
 morning."
 By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
 old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers
 all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he
 threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal
 spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
 clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining
 very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,
 which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,
 away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and
 grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
 green of the new foliage.
 "Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
 enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
