photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the
 right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a
 glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it
 was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed
 from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making
 my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to
 attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had
 come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
 wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
 "And now?" I asked.
 "Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
 to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
 shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is
 probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
 photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain
 it with his own hands."
 "And when will you call?"
 "At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall
 have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage
 may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to
 the King without delay."
 We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
 searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
 "Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
 There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
 greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
 hurried by.
 "I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the
 dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have
 been."
