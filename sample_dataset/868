been my choice); and particularly, that if ever I married, if they would
 not insist upon the man I had an aversion to, it should not be with the
 man they disliked--
 He interrupted me here: He hoped I would forgive him for it; but
 he could not help expressing his great concern, that, after so many
 instances of his passionate and obsequious devotion--
 And pray, Sir, said I, let me interrupt you in my turn;--Why don't you
 assert, in still plainer words, the obligation you have laid me under by
 this your boasted devotion? Why don't you let me know, in terms as high
 as your implication, that a perseverance I have not wished for, which
 has set all my relations at variance with me, is a merit that throws
 upon me the guilt of ingratitude for not having answered it as you seem
 to expect?
 I must forgive him, he said, if he, who pretended only to a comparative
 merit, (and otherwise thought no man living could deserve me,) had
 presumed to hope for a greater share in my favour, than he had hitherto
 met with, when such men as Mr. Symmes, Mr. Wyerley, and now, lastly, so
 vile a reptile as this Solmes, however discouraged by myself, were made
 his competitors. As to the perseverance I mentioned, it was impossible
 for him not to persevere: but I must needs know, that were he not in
 being, the terms Solmes had proposed were such, as would have involved
 me in the same difficulties with my relations that I now laboured under.
 He therefore took the liberty to say, that my favour to him, far from
 increasing those difficulties, would be the readiest way to extricate me
 from them. They had made it impossible [he told me, with too much truth]
 to oblige them any way, but by sacrificing myself to Solmes. They were
 well apprized besides of the difference between the two; one, whom they
 hoped to manage as they pleased; the other, who could and would protect
 me from every insult; and who had natural prospects much superior to my
 brother's foolish views of a title.
