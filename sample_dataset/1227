Tuesday to dinner; and she is to stay with me for a whole week.
 So she is first to endeavour to persuade me to comply; and, when the
 violence is done, she is to comfort me, and try to reconcile me to
 my fate. They expect fits and fetches, Betty insolently tells me, and
 expostulations, and exclamations, without number: but every body will
 be prepared for them: and when it's over, it's over; and I shall be easy
 and pacified when I find I can't help it.
 MONDAY MORN. APRIL 10, SEVEN O'CLOCK.
 O my dear! there yet lies the letter, just as I left it!
 Does he think he is so sure of me?--Perhaps he imagines that I dare not
 alter my purpose. I wish I had never known him! I begin now to see this
 rashness in the light every one else would have seen it in, had I been
 guilty of it. But what can I do, if he come to-day at the appointed
 time! If he receive not the letter, I must see him, or he will think
 something has befallen me; and certainly will come to the house. As
 certainly he will be insulted. And what, in that case, may be the
 consequence! Then I as good as promised that I would take the first
 opportunity to see him, if I change my mind, and to give him my reasons
 for it. I have no doubt but he will be out of humour upon it: but
 better, if we meet, that he should go away dissatisfied with me, than
 that I should go away dissatisfied with myself.
 Yet, short as the time is, he may still perhaps send, and get the
 letter. Something may have happened to prevent him, which when known
 will excuse him.
 After I have disappointed him more than once before, on a requested
 interview only, it is impossible he should not have a curiosity at
 least, to know if something has not happened; and whether my mind hold
 or not in this more important case. And yet, as I rashly confirmed my
 resolution by a second letter, I begin now to doubt it.
 NINE O'CLOCK.
