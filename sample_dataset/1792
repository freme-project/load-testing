unforseen events, out of it: for, as to my donations, I would generally
 confine myself in them to the tenth of my income, be it what it would.  I
 aim at no glare in what I do of that sort.  All I wish for, is the power
 of relieving the lame, the blind, the sick, and the industrious poor, and
 those whom accident has made so, or sudden distress reduced.  The common
 or bred beggars I leave to others, and to the public provision.  They
 cannot be lower: perhaps they wish not to be higher: and, not able to do
 for every one, I aim not at works of supererogation.  Two hundred pounds
 a year would do all I wish to do of the separate sort: for all above, I
 would content myself to ask you; except, mistrusting your own economy,
 you would give up to my management and keeping, in order to provide for
 future contingencies, a larger portion; for which, as your steward, I
 would regularly account.
 'As to clothes, I have particularly two suits, which, having been only in
 a manner tried on, would answer for any present occasion.  Jewels I have
 of my grandmother's, which want only new-setting: another set I have,
 which on particular days I used to wear.  Although these are not sent me,
 I have no doubt, being merely personals, but they will, when I should
 send for them in another name: till when I should not choose to wear any.
 'As to your complaints of my diffidences, and the like, I appeal to your
 own heart, if it be possible for you to make my case your own for one
 moment, and to retrospect some parts of your behaviour, words, and
 actions, whether I am not rather to be justified than censured: and
 whether, of all the men in the world, avowing what you avow, you ought
 not to think so.  If you do not, let me admonish you, Sir, from the very
 great mismatch that then must appear to be in our minds, never to seek,
 nor so much as to wish, to bring about the most intimate union of
 interests between yourself and
 CLARISSA HARLOWE.
 MAY 20.'
