What at present most concerns me, is, the peace of my mother's mind!
 How can the husband of such a wife (a good man too!--But oh! this
 prerogative of manhood!) be so positive, so unpersuadable, to one who
 has brought into the family means, which they know so well the value of,
 that methinks they should value her the more for their sake?

 since, as I am just now informed, a lawyer has been this very day
 consulted [Would you have believed it?] in relation to settlements.
 Were ours a Roman Catholic family, how much happier for me, that they

 valued that in either which is above title, that which is truly noble in
 both!
 But by what a long-reaching selfishness is my brother governed! By what
 remote, exceedingly remote views! Views, which it is in the power of the
 slightest accident, of a fever, for instance, (the seeds of which are
