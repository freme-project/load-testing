branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
 very old mansion.
 "Stoke Moran?" said he.
 "Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked
 the driver.
 "There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is
 where we are going."
 "There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of
 roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the
 house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by
 the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is
 walking."
 "And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading
 his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
 We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way
 to Leatherhead.
 "I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
 "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or
 on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.
 Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as
 our word."
 Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
 face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for
 you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned
 out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely
 that he will be back before evening."
 "We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"
 said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had
 occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
 "Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
