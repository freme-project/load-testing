vexation, to be driven to such streights and difficulties, here at
 home, as oblige me to answer letters, (from a man I had not absolutely
 intended to encourage, and to whom I had really great objections,)
 filled as his are with such warm protestations, and written to me with a
 spirit of expectation.
 For, my dear, you never knew so bold a supposer. As commentators find
 beauties in an author, to which the author perhaps was a stranger; so he
 sometimes compliments me in high strains of gratitude for favours, and
 for a consideration, which I never designed him; insomuch that I am
 frequently under a necessity of explaining away the attributed goodness
 to him, which, if I shewed, I should have the less opinion of myself.
 In short, my dear, like a restiff horse, (as I have heard described by
 sportsmen,) he pains one's hands, and half disjoints one's arms, to rein
 him in. And, when you see his letters, you must form no judgment upon
 them, till you have read my answers. If you do, you will indeed think
 you have cause to attribute self-deceit, and throbs, and glows, to your
 friend: and yet, at other times, the contradictory nature complains,
 that I shew him as little favour, and my friends as much inveteracy,
 as if, in the rencontre betwixt my brother and him, he had been the
 aggressor; and as if the catastrophe had been as fatal, as it might have
 been.
 If he has a design by this conduct (sometimes complaining of my shyness,
 at others exalting in my imaginary favours) to induce me at one time to
 acquiesce with his compliments; at another to be more complaisant
 for his complaints; and if the contradiction be not the effect of his
 inattention and giddiness; I shall think him as deep and as artful (too
 probably, as practised) a creature, as ever lived; and were I to be sure
 of it, should hate him, if possible, worse than I do Solmes.
 But enough for the present of a creature so very various.
