myself so foolishly accountable for too many of them. Rest is departed
 from me. I have no call for that: and that has no balm for the wounds
 of my mind. So you'll have all those hours without interruption till the
 account is ended.
 But will you receive, shall you be permitted to receive my letters,
 after what I have done?
 O my dearest friend!--But I must make the best of it.
 I hope that will not be very bad! yet am I convinced that I did a rash
 and inexcusable thing in meeting him; and all his tenderness, all his
 vows, cannot pacify my inward reproaches on that account.
 The bearer comes to you, my dear, for the little parcel of linen which I
 sent you with far better and more agreeable hopes.
 Send not my letters. Send the linen only: except you will favour me with
 one line, to tell me you love me still; and that you will suspend your
 censures till you have the whole before you. I am the readier to send
 thus early, because if you have deposited any thing for me, you may
 cause it to be taken back, or withhold any thing you had but intended to
 send.
 Adieu, my dearest friend!--I beseech you to love me still--But
 alas! what will your mother say?--what will mine?--what my other
 relations?--and what my dear Mrs. Norton?--and how will my brother and
 sister triumph!
 I cannot at present tell you how, or where, you can direct to me. For
 very early shall I leave this place; harassed and fatigued to death.
 But, when I can do nothing else, constant use has made me able to write.
 Long, very long, has been all my amusement and pleasure: yet could not
 that have been such to me, had I not had you, my best beloved friend, to
 write to. Once more adieu. Pity and pray for
 LETTER I
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TUESDAY, NINE O'CLOCK.
