money, one would be loth, a twelvemonth hence, that the poor old fellow
 should think he had reason to wish the bounty never conferred.
 I MUST give you your way in these things, you say.--And I know there is
 no contradicting you: for you were ever putting too great a value upon
 little offices done for you, and too little upon the great ones you do
 for others. The satisfaction you have in doing so, I grant it, repays
 you. But why should you, by the nobleness of your mind, throw reproaches
 upon the rest of the world? particularly, upon your own family--and upon
 ours too?
 If, as I have heard you say, it is a good rule to give WORDS the
 hearing, but to form our judgment of men and things by DEEDS ONLY;
 what shall we think of one, who seeks to find palliatives in words, for
 narrowness of heart in the very persons her deeds so silently, yet so
 forcibly, reflect upon? Why blush you not, my dear friend, to be thus
 singular?--When you meet with another person whose mind is like your
 own, then display your excellencies as you please: but till then,
 for pity's sake, let your heart and your spirit suffer a little
 contradiction.
 I intended to write but a few lines; chiefly to let you know your
 parcels are come safe. And accordingly I began in a large hand; and I
 am already come to the end of my second sheet. But I could write a quire
 without hesitation upon a subject so copious and so beloved as is your
 praise. Not for this single instance of your generosity; since I am
 really angry with you for it; but for the benevolence exemplified in
 the whole tenor of your life and action; of which this is but a common
 instance. Heaven direct you, in your own arduous trials, is all I have
 room to add; and make you as happy, as you think to be
 Your own ANNA HOWE.

 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY NIGHT, APRIL 2.
