I was moving to go up--
 And will you go up, Clary?
 I turned my face to her: my officious tears would needs plead for me: I
 could not just then speak, and stood still.
 Good girl, distress me not thus!--Dear, good girl, do not thus distress
 me! holding out her hand; but standing still likewise.
 What can I do, Madam?--What can I do?
 Go in again, my child--Go in again, my dear child!--repeated she; and
 let your father find you together.
 What, Madam, to give him hope?--To give hope to Mr. Solmes?
 Obstinate, perverse, undutiful Clarissa! with a rejecting hand, and
 angry aspect; then take your own way, and go up!--But stir not down
 again, I charge you, without leave, or till your father's pleasure be
 known concerning you.
 She flung away from me with high indignation: and I went up with a very
 heavy heart; and feet as slow as my heart was heavy.
 My father is come home, and my brother with him. Late as it is, they are
 all shut up together. Not a door opens; not a soul stirs. Hannah, as she
 moves up and down, is shunned as a person infected.
 The angry assembly is broken up. My two uncles and my aunt Hervey are
 sent for, it seems, to be here in the morning to breakfast. I shall
 then, I suppose, know my doom. 'Tis past eleven, and I am ordered not to
 go to bed.
 TWELVE O'CLOCK.
 This moment the keys of every thing are taken from me. It was proposed
 to send for me down: but my father said, he could not bear to look upon
 me.--Strange alteration in a few weeks!--Shorey was the messenger. The
 tears stood in her eyes when she delivered her message.
 You, my dear, are happy--May you always be so--and then I can never be
 wholly miserable. Adieu, my beloved friend!
