present measures are not entered upon with her own natural liking, she
 will have the less pain, should they want the success which I think in
 my heart they ought to want.
 I have run a great length in a very little time. The subject touched me
 to the quick. My reflections upon it will give you reason to expect from
 me a perhaps too steady behaviour in a new conference, which, I find, I
 must have with my mother. My father and brother, as she was pleased
 to tell me, dine at my uncle Antony's; and that, as I have reason to
 believe, on purpose to give an opportunity for it.
 Hannah informs me, that she heard my father high and angry with my
 mother, at taking leave of her: I suppose for being to favourable to me;
 for Hannah heard her say, as in tears, 'Indeed, Mr. Harlowe, you greatly
 distress me!--The poor girl does not deserve--' Hannah heard no more,
 but that he said, he would break somebody's heart--Mine, I suppose--Not
 my mother's, I hope.
 As only my sister dines with my mother, I thought I should have been
 commanded down: but she sent me up a plate from her table. I continued
 my writing. I could not touch a morsel. I ordered Hannah however to eat
 of it, that I might not be thought sullen.
 Before I conclude this, I will see whether any thing offers from either
 of my private correspondencies, that will make it proper to add to it;
 and will take a turn in the wood-yard and garden for that purpose.
 I am stopped. Hannah shall deposit this. She was ordered by my mother
 (who asked where I was) to tell me, that she would come up and talk with
 me in my own closet.--She is coming! Adieu, my dear.

 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SAT. AFTERNOON.
 The expected conference is over: but my difficulties are increased.
 This, as my mother was pleased to tell me, being the last persuasory
 effort that is to be attempted, I will be particular in the account of
