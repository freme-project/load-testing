obligation which Mr. Hervey's indifferent conduct in his affairs has
 laid him under--it is only, it seems, that your brother has paid off
 for him a mortgage upon one part of his estate, which the mortgagee was
 about to foreclose; and taken it upon himself. A small favour (as he has
 ample security in his hands) from kindred to kindred: but such a one, it
 is plain, as has laid the whole family of the Herveys under obligation
 to the ungenerous lender, who has treated him, and his aunt too (as
 Miss Dolly Hervey has privately complained), with the less ceremony ever
 since.
 Must I, my dear, call such a creature your brother?--I believe I
 must--Because he is your father's son. There is no harm, I hope, in
 saying that.
 I am concerned, that you ever wrote at all to him. It was taking too
 much notice of him: it was adding to his self-significance; and a call
 upon him to treat you with insolence. A call which you might have been
 assured he would not fail to answer.
 But such a pretty master as this, to run riot against such a man as
 Lovelace; who had taught him to put his sword into his scabbard, when
 he had pulled it out by accident!--These in-door insolents, who, turning
 themselves into bugbears, frighten women, children, and servants, are
 generally cravens among men. Were he to come fairly across me, and say
 to my face some of the free things which I am told he has said of me
 behind my back, or that (as by your account) he has said of our sex, I
 would take upon myself to ask him two or three questions; although he
 were to send me a challenge likewise.
 I repeat, you know that I will speak my mind, and write it too. He is
 not my brother. Can you say, he is yours?--So, for your life, if you
 are just, you can't be angry with me: For would you side with a false
 brother against a true friend? A brother may not be a friend: but a
 friend will always be a brother--mind that, as your uncle Tony says!
