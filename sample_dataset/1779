pranks in the passed day.
 I, in like manner, will discard all my boisterous inventions: and if I
 can oblige my sweet traveller to throw aside, but for one moment, the
 cloak of her rigid virtue, I shall have nothing to do, but, like the sun,
 to bless new objects with my rays.  But my chosen hours of conversation
 and repose, after all my peregrinations, will be devoted to my goddess.
 And now, Belford, according to my new system, I think this house of Mrs.
 Fretchville an embarrass upon me.  I will get rid of it; for some time at
 least.  Mennell, when I am out, shall come to her, inquiring for me.
 What for? thou'lt ask.  What for--hast thou not heard what has befallen
 poor Mrs. Fretchville?--Then I'll tell thee.
 One of her maids, about a week ago, was taken with the small-pox.  The
 rest kept their mistress ignorant of it till Friday; and then she came to
 know of it by accident.  The greater half of the plagues poor mortals of
 condition are tormented with, proceed from the servants they take, partly
 for show, partly for use, and with a view to lessen their cares.
 This has so terrified the widow, that she is taken with all the symptoms
 that threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair faces.--So must
 not think of removing: yet cannot expect, that we should be further
 delayed on her account.
 She now wishes, with all her heart, that she had known her own mind, and
 gone into the country at first when I treated about the house.  This evil
 then had not happened! a cursed cross accident for us, too!--Heigh-ho!
 nothing else, I think, in this mortal life! people need not study to
 bring crosses upon themselves by their petulancies.
 So this affair of the house will be over; at least for one while.  But
 then I can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this
 disappointment.  I must move slow, in order to be sure.  I have a
 charming contrivance or two in my head, even supposing my beloved should
 get away, to bring her back again.
