M.   I wanted to advise with you upon it.--But you are such a strange
 creature!--you are always for answering one before one speaks!
 D.   You'll be so good as to forgive me, Madam.--But I thought every body
 (he among the rest) knew that you had always declared against a second
 marriage.
 M.   And so I have.  But then it was in the mind I was in.  Things may
 offer----
 I stared.
 M.   Nay, don't be surprised!--I don't intend--I don't intend--
 D.   Not, perhaps, in the mind you are in, Madam.
 M.   Pert creature! [rising again]----We shall quarrel, I see!--There's
 no----
 D.   Once more, dear Madam, I beg your excuse.  I will attend in silence.
 --Pray, Madam, sit down again--pray do [she sat down.]--May I see the
 letter?
 No; there are some things in it you won't like.--Your temper is known, I
 find, to be unhappy.  But nothing bad against you; intimations, on the
 contrary, that you shall be the better for him, if you oblige him.
 Not a living soul but the Harlowes, I said, thought me ill-tempered: and
 I was contented that they should, who could do as they had done by the
 most universally acknowledged sweetness in the world.
 Here we broke out a little; but at last she read me some of the passages
 in the letter.  But not the most mightily ridiculous: yet I could hardly
 keep my countenance neither, especially when she came to that passage
 which mentions his sound health; and at which she stopped; she best knew
 why--But soon resuming:
 M.   Well now, Nancy, tell me what you think of it.
 D.   Nay, pray, Madam, tell me what you think of it.
 M.   I expect to be answered by an answer; not by a question!  You don't
 use to be so shy to speak your mind.
