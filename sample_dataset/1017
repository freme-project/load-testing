tenacious. And if she believes her friends to be wrong, although perhaps
 they may be only so in their methods of treating her, how much will
 every unkind circumstance on the parent's part, or heedless one on the
 child's, though ever so slight in itself, widen the difference! The
 parent's prejudice in disfavour, will confirm the daughter's in favour,
 of the same person; and the best reasonings in the world on either side,
 will be attributed to that prejudice. In short, neither of them will be
 convinced: a perpetual opposition ensues: the parent grows impatient;

 out which the mother was most afraid of, and which possibly had not
 happened, if the child's passions had been only led, not driven.'
 My mother was pleased with the whole letter; and said, It deserved to
 have the success it met with. But asked me what excuse could be offered
 for a young lady capable of making such reflections (and who at her time

 himself the liberties he is said to take; and who indeed himself denies
 not the accusation; having been heard to declare, that he will do all
 the mischief he can to the sex, in revenge for the ill usage and
 broken vows of his first love, at a time when he was too young [his own
 expression it seems] to be insincere.
 I replied, that I had heard every one say, that the lady meant really
 used him ill; that it affected him so much at the time, that he was
 forced to travel upon it; and to drive her out of his heart, ran into
 courses which he had ingenuousness enough himself to condemn: that,
 however, he had denied that he had thrown out such menaces against the
 sex when charged with them by me in your presence; and declared himself
 incapable of so unjust and ungenerous a resentment against all, for the
