was his warmth received by my brother, that I began to suspect, that it
 was a contrivance to make me think myself obliged to him; and that this
 might perhaps be one end of the pressed-for interview.
 The very suspicion of this low artifice, violent as I was thought to be
 before, put me still more out of patience; and my uncle and my brother
 again praising his wonderful generosity, and his noble return of good
 for evil, You are a happy man, Mr. Solmes, said I, that you can
 so easily confer obligations upon a whole family, except upon one
 ungrateful person of it, whom you seem to intend most to oblige; but
 who being made unhappy by your favour, desires not to owe to you any
 protection from the violence of a brother.
 Then was I a rude, an ungrateful, and unworthy creature.
 I own it all--all, all you can call me, or think me, Brother, do I own.
 I own my unworthiness with regard to this gentleman. I take your word
 for his abundant merit, which I have neither leisure nor inclination to
 examine into--it may perhaps be as great as your own--but yet I cannot
 thank him for his great mediation: For who sees not, looking at my
 uncle, that this is giving himself a merit with every body at my
 expense?
 Then turning to my brother, who seemed surprised into silence by my
 warmth, I must also acknowledge, Sir, the favour of your superabundant
 care for me. But I discharge you of it; at least, while I have the
 happiness of nearer and dearer relations. You have given me no reason to
 think better of your prudence, than of my own. I am independent of you,
 Sir, though I never desire to be so of my father: and although I wish
 for the good opinion of my uncles, it is all I wish for from them: and
 this, Sir, I repeat, to make you and my sister easy.
 Instantly almost came in Betty, in a great hurry, looking at me as
 spitefully as if she were my sister: Sir, said she to my brother, my
 master desires to speak with you this moment at the door.
