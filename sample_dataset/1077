afterwards. Robin shall fetch it away on the first orders by day or by
 night.
 I am in hopes to procure from my mother, if things come to extremity,
 leave for you to be privately with us.
 I will condition to be good-humoured, and even kind, to HER favourite,
 if she will shew me an indulgence that shall make me serviceable to
 MINE.
 This alternative has been a good while in my head. But as your foolish
 uncle has so strangely attached my mother to their views, I cannot
 promise that I shall succeed as I wish.
 Do not absolutely despair, however. What though the contention will be
 between woman and woman? I fancy I shall be able to manage it, by the
 help of a little female perseverance. Your quarrel with Lovelace, if
 it continue, will strengthen my hands. And the offers you made in your
 answer to your uncle Harlowe's letter of Sunday night last, duly dwelt
 upon, must add force to my pleas.
 I depend upon your forgiveness of all the perhaps unseasonable
 flippancies of your naturally too lively, yet most sincerely
 sympathizing, ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER XXV
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY, MARCH 31.
 You have very kindly accounted for your silence. People in misfortune
 are always in doubt. They are too apt to turn even unavoidable accidents
 into slights and neglects; especially in those whose favourable opinion
 they wish to preserve.
 I am sure I ought evermore to exempt my Anna Howe from the supposed
 possibility of her becoming one of those who bask only in the sun-shine
 of a friend: but nevertheless her friendship is too precious to me, not
 to doubt my own merits on the one hand, and not to be anxious for the
 preservation of it, on the other.
