very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
 "I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is
 wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
 whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
 sufficient punishment."
 XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
 "To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock
 Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily
 Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
 manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is
 pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped
 this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
 have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
 occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much
 to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I
 have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
 trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those
 faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made
 my special province."
 "And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved
 from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
 records."
 "You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing
 cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
 pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
 disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred
 perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
 statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
 upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
 really the only notable feature about the thing."
