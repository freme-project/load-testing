mother's meekness has confirmed them, and given them greater reason to
 expect the first.
 My aunt HERVEY (not extremely happy in her own nuptials, and perhaps
 under some little obligation) is got over, and chuses [sic] not to
 open her lips in my favour against the wills of a father and uncles so
 determined.
 This passiveness in my mother and in my aunt, in a point so contrary
 to their own first judgments, is too strong a proof that my father is
 absolutely resolved.
 Their treatment of my worthy MRS. NORTON is a sad confirmation of it:
 a woman deserving of all consideration for her wisdom, and every body
 thinking so; but who, not being wealthy enough to have due weight in a
 point against which she has given her opinion, and which they seem
 bent upon carrying, is restrained from visiting here, and even from
 corresponding with me, as I am this very day informed.
 Hatred to Lovelace, family aggrandizement, and this great motive
 paternal authority!--What a force united must they be supposed to have,
 when singly each consideration is sufficient to carry all before it!
 This is the formidable appearance which the address of this disagreeable
 man wears at present.
 My BROTHER and my SISTER triumph.--They have got me down, as Hannah
 overheard them exult. And so they have (yet I never knew that I
 was insolently up); for now my brother will either lay me under an
 obligation to comply to my own unhappiness, and so make me an instrument
 of his revenge upon Lovelace; or, if I refuse, will throw me into
 disgrace with my whole family.
 Who will wonder at the intrigues and plots carried on by undermining
 courtiers against one another, when a private family, but three of which
 can possibly have clashing interests, and one of them (as she presumes
 to think) above such low motives, cannot be free from them?
