 Then, perhaps, they have no notion of the back-door; as it is seldom
 opened, and leads to a place so pathless and lonesome.* If not, there
 can be no other way to escape (if one would) unless by the plashy lane,
 so full of springs, by which your servant reaches the solitary wood

      propagated, are apt to leave impressions even upon minds
      grown strong enough at the same time to despise the like
      credulous follies in others.'
 The Ivy Summer-house is the most convenient for this heart-affecting
 purpose of any spot in the garden, as it is not far from the back-door,
 and yet in another alley, as you may remember. Then it is seldom
