without desponding, pursue your earnest purposes to amend what you think
 has been amiss; and it may not be a misfortune in the end that you have
 erred; especially as so little of your will was in your error.
 And indeed I must say that I use the words misled, and error, and such-
 like, only in compliment to your own too-ready self-accusations, and to
