creature so great a fool.
 Really, my dear, the man deserves not politer treatment.--And then has
 he not made a fool, an egregious fool of me?--I am afraid he himself
 thinks he has.
 I am surprised! I am amazed, Madam, returned he, at so strange a turn
 upon me!--I am very unhappy, that nothing I can do or say will give
 you a good opinion of me!--Would to heaven that I knew what I can do to
 obtain the honour of your confidence!
 I told him, that I desired his absence, of all things. I saw not,
 I said, that my friends thought it worth their while to give me
 disturbance: therefore, if he would set out for London, or Berkshire, or
 whither he pleased, it would be most agreeable to me, and most reputable
 too.
 He would do so, he said, he intended to do so, the moment I was in a
 place to my liking--in a place convenient for me.
 This, Sir, will be so, said I, when you are not here to break in upon
 me, and make the apartments inconvenient.
 He did not think this place safe, he replied; and as I intended not to
 stay here, he had not been so solicitous, as otherwise he should have
 been, to enjoin privacy to his servants, nor to Mrs. Greme at her
 leaving me; that there were two or three gentlemen at the neighbourhood,
 he said, with whose servants his gossiping fellows had scraped
 acquaintance: so that he could not think of leaving me here unguarded
 and unattended.--But fix upon any place in England where I could be
 out of danger, and he would go to the furthermost part of the king's
 dominions, if by doing so he could make me easy.
 I told him plainly that I should never be in humour with myself for
 meeting him; nor with him, for seducing me away: that my regrets
 increased, instead of diminished: that my reputation was wounded: that
 nothing I could do would now retrieve it: and that he must not wonder,
