 A confounded one it is; and which highly aggravates his other maladies:

 christened, you know, that her name might be nearer in sound to the
 christian name of the man whom she pretended to doat upon) has for many
 years carried on an intrigue with a fellow who had been hostler to her
 father (an innkeeper at Darking); of whom, at the expense of poor Belton,
 she has made a gentleman; and managed it so, that having the art to make
