perhaps complaisantly call it, of succeeding with me [and indeed, Sir,
 there cannot be a greater truth]; and that you will therefore no more
 think of me, but turn your thoughts another way.

 generosity, because he could not be happy without it, than I would a
 much more valuable treasure, to promote the felicity of another, and
 make his way easier to circumvent myself.

 undisposed of to some happier man, I must and will be
