having given you cause of offence, that I have in you a brother, but not
 a friend.
 Perhaps you will not condescend to enter into the reasons of your
 late and present conduct with a foolish sister. But if politeness, if
 civility, be not due to that character, and to my sex, justice is.
 Let me take the liberty further to observe, that the principal end of
 a young man's education at the university, is, to learn him to reason

 that the toilette has taught the one more of the latter doctrine, than
 the university has taught the other. I am truly sorry to have cause
 to say, that I have heard it often remarked, that your uncontrouled
 passions are not a credit to your liberal education.
 I hope, Sir, that you will excuse the freedom I have taken with you: you

 cease, and there will not be any where a more accomplished gentleman
 than my brother.
 Sisterly affection, I do assure you, Sir, (unkindly as you have used

 to me, is my motive in this hint. Let me invoke your returning kindness,
 my only brother! And give me cause, I beseech you, to call you my
 compassionating friend. For I am, and ever will be,
 Your affectionate sister, CLARISSA HARLOWE.

 I KNOW there will be no end of your impertinent scribble, if I don't
 write to you. I write therefore: but, without entering into argument
 with such a conceited and pert preacher and questioner, it is, to forbid
