innocent creature, who loves you so well, and who is in your protection, and
 has suffered so much for you, for the faults of her relations.
 And here let me put a serious question or two.  Thinkest thou, truly
 admirable as this lady is, that the end thou proposest to thyself, if
 obtained, is answerable to the means, to the trouble thou givest thyself,
 and to the perfidies, tricks, stratagems, and contrivances thou has

 judged by one, who never before was so much touched in a woman's favour;
 and whom thou knowest to be
 Thy partial friend,
 J. BELFORD.

 would set his name to it.  I would not delay sending it, for fear of some
