from a treatment so disgraceful; and which [God forgive me, if I judge
 amiss!] I am afraid my brother and sister would not be sorry to drive me
 to take.
 If, therefore, such a step should become necessary, (which I yet hope
 will not,) I must be contented to go away with the clothes I shall
 have on at the time. My custom to be dressed for the day, as soon as
 breakfast is over, when I have had no household employments to prevent
 me, will make such a step (if I am forced to take it) less suspected.
 And the linen I shall deposit, in pursuance of your kind hint, cannot be
 missed.
 This custom, although a prisoner, (as I may too truly say,) and neither
 visited nor visiting, I continue. We owe to ourselves, and to our sex,
 you know, to be always neat; and never to be surprised in a way we
 should be pained to be seen in.
 Besides, people in adversity (which is the state of trial of every good
 quality) should endeavour to preserve laudable customs, that, if sun
 shine return, they may not be losers by their trial.
 Does it not, moreover, manifest a firmness of mind, in an unhappy
 person, to keep hope alive? To hope for better days, is half to deserve
 them: for could we have just ground for such a hope, if we did not
 resolve to deserve what that hope bids us aspire to?--Then who shall
 befriend a person who forsakes herself?
 These are reflections by which I sometimes endeavour to support myself.
 I know you don't despise my grave airs, although (with a view no doubt
 to irradiate my mind in my misfortunes) you rally me upon them. Every
 body has not your talent of introducing serious and important lessons,
 in such a happy manner as at once to delight and instruct.
 What a multitude of contrivances may not young people fall upon, if the
 mind be not engaged by acts of kindness and condescension! I am not used
 by my friends of late as I always used their servants.
