 And now, Belford, are we in a train, or the deuce is in it.  Every
 fortified town has its strong and its weak place.  I have carried on my
 attacks against the impregnable parts.  I have not doubt but I shall
 either shine or smuggle her out of her cloke, since she and Miss Howe

 she was the more reserved, as he declined to tell her the motives of his
 inquiry.

 it back, to delay sending it, till he had recollected all this farrago of
