unconcernedness.
 When I approached her with what I had written, she arose with an air
 of levity--Why, love, you have not written already!--You have, I
 protest!--O what a ready penwoman!--And may I read it?
 If you please. And let me beseech you, my dear Bella, to back these
 proposals with your good offices: and [folding my uplifted hands; tears,
 I believe, standing in my eyes] I will love you as never sister loved
 another.
 Thou art a strange creature, said she; there is no withstanding thee.
 She took the proposals and letter; and having read them, burst into an
 affected laugh: How wise ones may be taken in!--Then you did not know,
 that I was jesting with you all this time!--And so you would have me
 carry down this pretty piece of nonsense?
 Don't let me be surprised at your seeming unsisterliness, Bella. I hope
 it is but seeming. There can be no wit in such jesting as this.
 The folly of the creature!--How natural is it for people, when they set
 their hearts upon any thing, to think every body must see with their
 eyes!--Pray, dear child, what becomes of your father's authority
 here?--Who stoops here, the parent, or the child?--How does this square
 with engagements actually agreed upon between your father and Mr.
 Solmes? What security, that your rake will not follow you to the world's
 end?--Nevertheless, that you may not think that I stand in the way of
 a reconciliation on such fine terms as these, I will be your messenger
 this once, and hear what my papa will say to it; although beforehand I
 can tell you, these proposals will not answer the principal end.
 So down she went. But, it seems, my aunt Hervey and my uncle Harlowe
 were not gone away: and as they have all engaged to act in concert,
 messengers were dispatched to my uncle and aunt to desire them to be
 there to breakfast in the morning.
 MONDAY NIGHT, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
