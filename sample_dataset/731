O my dear friend, I have had a sad conflict! Trial upon trial;
 conference upon conference!--But what law, what ceremony, can give a
 man a right to a heart which abhors him more than it does any living
 creature?
 I hope my mother will be able to prevail for me.--But I will recount it
 all, though I sit up the whole night to do it; for I have a vast deal to
 write, and will be as minute as you wish me to be.
 I concluded my last in a fright. It was occasioned by a conversation
 that passed between my mother and my aunt, part of which Hannah
 overheard. I need not give you the particulars; since what I have to

 I will begin then.
 I went down this morning when breakfast was ready with a very uneasy

 retired to her own apartment after breakfast: but, unluckily, there was
 the odious Solmes, sitting asquat between my mother and sister, with so
 much assurance in his looks!--But you know, my dear, that those we love
 not, cannot do any thing to please us.
 Had the wretch kept his seat, it might have been well enough: but the
 bend and broad-shouldered creature must needs rise, and stalk towards a
 chair, which was just by that which was set for me.
 I removed it to a distance, as if to make way to my own: and down I sat,
 abruptly I believe; what I had heard all in my head.
 But this was not enough to daunt him. The man is a very confident, he is
 a very bold, staring man!--Indeed, my dear, the man is very confident.
 He took the removed chair, and drew it so near mine, squatting in it
 with his ugly weight, that he pressed upon my hoop.--I was so offended
