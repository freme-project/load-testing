Rivalry! Madam, said I.--If that be the case, or whether it be or not,
 I wish they both understood, better than either of them seem to do,
 what it becomes gentlemen, and men of liberal education, to be, and to
 do.--Neither of them, then, would glory in what they ought to be ashamed
 But waving this subject, it was not impossible, I said, that they might
 find a little of my writing, and a pen or two, and a little ink, [hated
 art!--or rather, hateful the necessity for it!] as I was not permitted
 to go up to put them out of the way: but if they did, I must be
 contented. And I assured her, that, take what time they pleased, I would
 not go in to disturb them, but would be either in or near the garden,
 in this summer-house, or in the cedar one, or about my poultry-yard, or
 near the great cascade, till I was ordered to return to my prison. With
 like cunning I said, I supposed the unkind search would not be made
 till the servants had dined; because I doubted not that the pert Betty
 Barnes, who knew all the corners of my apartment and closet, would be
 employed in it.
 She hoped, she said, that nothing could be found that would give a
 handle against me: for, she would assure me, the motives to the search,
 on my mother's part especially, were, that she hoped to find reason
 rather to acquit than to blame me; and that my father might be induced
 to see my to-morrow night, or Wednesday morning, with temper: with
 tenderness, I should rather say, said she; for he is resolved to do so,
 if no new offence be given.
 Ah! Madam, said I--
 Why that Ah! Madam, and shaking your head so significantly?
 I wish, Madam, that I may not have more reason to dread my father's
 continued displeasure, than to hope for his returning tenderness.
 You don't know, my dear!--Things may take a turn--things may not be so
 bad as you fear--
 Dearest Madam, have you any consolation to give me?--
