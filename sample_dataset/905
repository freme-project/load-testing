you better. For, methinks, my sentences drag, my style creeps, my
 imagination is sunk, my spirits serve me not, only to tell you, that
 whether I have more or less, I am wholly devoted to the commands of my
 dear Miss Howe.
 P.S. The insolent Betty Barnes has just now fired me anew, by reporting
 to me the following expressions of the hideous creature, Solmes--'That
 he is sure of the coy girl; and that with little labour to himself. That
 be I ever so averse to him beforehand, he can depend upon my principles;
 and it will be a pleasure to him to see by what pretty degrees I shall
 come to.' [Horrid wretch!] 'That it was Sir Oliver's observation, who
 knew the world perfectly well, that fear was a better security than
 love, for a woman's good behaviour to her husband; although, for his
 part, to such a fine creature [truly] he would try what love would do,
 for a few weeks at least; being unwilling to believe what the old knight
 used to aver, that fondness spoils more wives than it makes good.'
 What think you, my dear, of such a wretch as this! tutored, too, by that
 old surly misogynist, as he was deemed, Sir Oliver?--
 LETTER XLI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY, MARCH 21.
 How willingly would my dear mother shew kindness to me, were she
 permitted! None of this persecution should I labour under, I am sure, if
 that regard were paid to her prudence and fine understanding, which they
 so well deserve. Whether owing to her, or to my aunt, or to both, that
 a new trial was to be made upon me, I cannot tell, but this morning her
 Shorey delivered into my hand the following condescending letter.
 MY DEAR GIRL,
 For so I must still call you; since dear you may be to me, in every
 sense of the word--we have taken into particular consideration some
 hints that fell yesterday from your good Norton, as if we had not, at
 Mr. Solmes's first application, treated you with that condescension,
