would have used it. Your aunt has been forced to engage not to interfere

 any favour to hope for, it must be from the mediation of your uncles.
 And yet, I believe, they are equally determined: for they make it a
 principle, [alas! they never had children!] that that child, who in
 marriage is not governed by her parents, is to be given up as a lost

 I charge you, let not this letter be found. Burn it. There is too much
