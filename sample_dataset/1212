withdraw with him, (and in that case you must let him be judge when he
 can leave you with safety, you'll observe that,) you should not postpone
 the ceremony.
 Give this matter your most serious consideration. Punctilio is out of
 doors the moment you are out of your father's house. I know how justly
 severe you have been upon those inexcusable creatures, whose giddiness
 and even want of decency have made them, in the same hour as I may
 say, leap from a parent's window to a husband's bed--but considering
 Lovelace's character, I repeat my opinion, that your reputation in the
 eye of the world requires no delay be made in this point, when once you
 are in his power.
 I need not, I am sure, make a stronger plea to you.
 You say, in excuse for my mother, (what my fervent love for my friend
 very ill brooks,) that we ought not to blame any one for not doing what
 she has an opinion to do, or to let alone. This, in cases of friendship,
 would admit of very strict discussion. If the thing requested be of
 greater consequence, or even of equal, to the person sought to, and it
 were, as the old phrase has it, to take a thorn out of one's friend's
 foot to put in into one's own, something might be said.--Nay, it would
 be, I will venture to say, a selfish thing in us to ask a favour of
 a friend which would subject that friend to the same or equal
 inconvenience as that from which we wanted to be relieved, The requested
 would, in this case, teach his friend, by his own selfish example, with
 much better reason, to deny him, and despise a friendship so merely
 nominal. But if, by a less inconvenience to ourselves, we could relieve
 our friend from a greater, the refusal of such a favour makes the
 refuser unworthy of the name of friend: nor would I admit such a one,
 not even into the outermost fold of my heart.
 I am well aware that this is your opinion of friendship, as well as
 mine: for I owe the distinction to you, upon a certain occasion; and it
