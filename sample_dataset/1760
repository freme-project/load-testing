however.  A good moral use, she says, may be made of my 'having prevailed
 upon her to swerve.'  I am glad that any good may flow from my actions.
 Annexed to this letter is a paper the most saucy that ever was written of
 a mother by a daughter.  There are in it such free reflections upon
 widows and bachelors, that I cannot but wonder how Miss Howe came by her
 learning.  Sir George Colmar, I can tell thee, was a greater fool than
 thy friend, if she had it all for nothing.
 The contents of this paper acquaint Miss Harlowe, that her uncle Antony
 has been making proposals of marriage to her mother.
 The old fellow's heart ought to be a tough one, if he succeed; or she who
 broke that of a much worthier man, the late Mr. Howe, will soon get rid
 of him.
 But be this as it may, the stupid family is made more irreconcilable than
 ever to their goddess-daughter for old Antony's thoughts of marrying: so
 I am more secure of her than ever.  And yet I believe at last, that my
 tender heart will be moved in her favour.  For I did not wish that she
 should have nothing but persecution and distress.--But why loves she the
 brutes, as Miss Howe justly calls them, so much; me so little?
 I have still more unpardonable transcripts from other letters.

 I see by it to what her displeasure with me, in relation to my proposals,
 was owing.  They were not summed up, it seems, with the warmth, with the
 ardour, which she had expected.
 This whole letter was transcribed by Dorcas, to whose lot it fell.  Thou
 shalt have copies of them all at full length shortly.
