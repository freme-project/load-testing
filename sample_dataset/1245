is at hand--and, by this sweet condescension, you have obliged me beyond
 expression or return.
 Recovering my spirits a little, as he kept drawing me after him, O Mr.
 Lovelace, said I, I cannot go with you--indeed I cannot--I wrote you
 word so--let go my hand, and you shall see my letter. It is lain there
 from yesterday morning, till within this half-hour. I bid you watch to
 the last for a letter from me, lest I should be obliged to revoke the
 appointment; and, had you followed the direction, you would have found
 I have been watched, my dearest life, said he, half out of breath--I
 have been watched in every step I took: and my trusty servant has been
 watched too, ever since Saturday; and dared not to come near your
 wall. And here we shall be discovered in a moment.--Speed away, my
 charmer--this is the moment of your deliverance--if you neglect this
 opportunity, you can never have such another.
 What is it you mean, Sir?--Let go my hand: for I tell you [struggling
 vehemently] that I will sooner die than go with you.
 Good God! said he, with a look of wildness and surprise, what is it I
 hear?--But [still drawing me after him, as he retreated farther from the
 door] it is no time to argue--by all that's good you must go--surely you
 cannot doubt my honour, nor give me cause to question your own.
 As you value me, Mr. Lovelace, urge me no farther. I come fixed and
 resolved. Let me give you the letter I have written. My further reasons
 shall follow; and they will convince you that I ought not to go.
 Nothing, Madam, can convince me--by all that's sacred, I will not leave
 you. To leave you now, would be to lose you for ever--
 Am I to be thus compelled? interrupted I, with equal indignation and
 vehemence.--Let go my hands--I am resolved not to go with you--and I
 will convince you that I ought not.
 All my friends expect you, Madam--all your own are determined against
 you--Wednesday next is the day, the important, perhaps the fatal day!
