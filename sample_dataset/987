Come along, Child! Come along, Meekness--taking my hand, and leading me
 towards the door--Demand it of them now--you'll find both your despised
 parents together!--What! does your heart fail you?--for I resisted,
 being thus insolently offered to be led, and pulled my hand from her.
 I want not to be led, said I; and since I can plead your invitation, I
 will go: and was posting to the stairs accordingly in my passion--but
 she got between me and the door, and shut it--
