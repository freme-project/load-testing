time I attend her, I find that she is less in my power; I more in hers.
 Yet, a foolish little rogue! to forbid me to think of marriage till I am
 a reformed man! Till the implacables of her family change their natures,
 and become placable!
 It is true, when she was for making those conditions, she did not think,
 that without any, she should be cheated out of herself; for so the dear
 soul, as I may tell thee in its place, phrases it.
 How it swells my pride, to have been able to outwit such a vigilant

 the female affectation of denying thy love, will avail thee now, with a
 heart so proud and so jealous as mine?--Remember, moreover, that all thy
