been that moment in your situation, and been so treated, I would have
 torn his eyes out, and left it to his own heart, when I had done, to
 furnish the reason for it.
 Would to Heaven to-morrow, without complimenting any body, might be his
 happy day!--Villain!  After he had himself suggested the compliment!--And
 I think he accuses YOU of delaying!--Fellow, that he is!--How my heart is
 wrung--
 But as matters now stand betwixt you, I am very unseasonable in
 expressing my resentments against him.--Yet I don't know whether I am or
 not, neither; since it is the most cruel of fates, for a woman to be
 forced to have a man whom her heart despises.  You must, at least,
 despise him; at times, however.  His clenched fist offered to his
 forehead on your leaving him in just displeasure--I wish it had been a
 pole-axe, and in the hand of his worst enemy.
 I will endeavour to think of some method, of some scheme, to get you from
 him, and to fix you safely somewhere till your cousin Morden arrives--A
 scheme to lie by you, and to be pursued as occasion may be given.  You
 are sure, that you can go abroad when you please? and that our
 correspondence is safe?  I cannot, however (for the reasons heretofore
 mentioned respecting your own reputation,) wish you to leave him while he
 gives you not cause to suspect his honour.  But your heart I know would be
 the easier, if you were sure of some asylum in case of necessity.
 Yet once more, I say, I can have no notion that he can or dare mean your
 dishonour.  But then the man is a fool, my dear--that's all.
 However, since you are thrown upon a fool, marry the fool at the first
 opportunity; and though I doubt that this man will be the most
 ungovernable of fools, as all witty and vain fools are, take him as a
 punishment, since you cannot as a reward: in short, as one given to
 convince you that there is nothing but imperfection in this life.
 And what is the result of all I have written, but this--Either marry,
