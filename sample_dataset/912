changed! Would to the Lord, your sex knew how to distinguish! It is
 plain, that she relies upon her power over you. The fond mother ever
 made a hardened child!
 She was pleased, however, to blame Betty, as the wench owned, for giving
 my answer its full force. But my father praised her for it.
 The wench says, that he would have come up in his wrath, at my refusing
 to see Mr. Solmes, had not my brother and sister prevailed upon him to

 Well, indeed, might my mother say, that I should have severe trials.*
 * See Letter XXV.
 P.S. The idiot [such a one am I treated like!] is begged, as I may say,

 on my father's part, I understand, but not yet on my mother's,] what
 cruelty may I not expect from their envy, jealousy, and ill-will!--I
 shall soon see, by its effects, if I am to be so consigned. This is a
