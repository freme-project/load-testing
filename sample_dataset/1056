TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE
 GOOD GOD!
 What is now to become of me!--How shall I support this
 disappointment!--No new cause!--On one knee, kneeling with the other, I
 write!--My feet benumbed with midnight wanderings through the heaviest
 dews that ever fell: my wig and my linen dripping with the hoar frost
 dissolving on them!--Day but just breaking--Sun not risen to exhale--May
 it never rise again!--Unless it bring healing and comfort to a benighted
 soul! In proportion to the joy you had inspired (ever lovely promiser!)
 in such proportion is my anguish!
 O my beloved creature!--But are not your very excuses confessions of
 excuses inexcusable? I know not what I write!--That servant in your
 way!* By the great God of Heaven, that servant was not, dared not, could
 not, be in your way!--Curse upon the cool caution that is pleased to
 deprive me of an expectation so transporting!
      * See Letter XIX.
 And are things drawing towards a crisis between your friends and
 you?--Is not this a reason for me to expect, the rather to expect, the
 promised interview?
 CAN I write all that is in my mind, say you?--Impossible!--Not the
 hundredth part of what is in my mind, and in my apprehension, can I
 write!
 Oh! the wavering, the changeable sex!--But can Miss Clarissa Harlowe--
 Forgive me, Madam!--I know not what I write!
 Yet, I must, I do, insist upon your promise--or that you will condescend
 to find better excuses for the failure--or convince me, that stronger
 reasons are imposed upon you, than those you offer.--A promise once
 given (upon deliberation given,) the promised only can dispense with;
 except in cases of a very apparent necessity imposed upon the promiser,
 which leaves no power to perform it.
