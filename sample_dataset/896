But it is impossible, say some, that he should make a tender or kind
 husband. Those who are for imposing upon me such a man as Mr. Solmes,
 and by methods so violent, are not entitled to make this objection. But
 now, on this subject, let me tell you how I have argued with myself--for
 still you must remember, that I am upon the extenuating part of his
 character.
 A great deal of the treatment a wife may expect from him, will possibly
 depend upon herself. Perhaps she must practise as well as promise
 obedience, to a man so little used to controul; and must be careful to
 oblige. And what husband expects not this?--The more perhaps if he had
 not reason to assure himself of the preferable love of his wife before
 she became such. And how much easier and pleasanter to obey the man of
 her choice, if he should be even more unreasonable sometimes, than one
 she would not have had, could she have avoided it? Then, I think, as
 the men were the framers of the matrimonial office, and made obedience
 a part of the woman's vow, she ought not, even in policy, to shew him,
 that she can break through her part of the contract, (however lightly
 she may think of the instance,) lest he should take it into his head
 (himself is judge) to think as lightly of other points, which she may
 hold more important--but, indeed, no point so solemnly vowed can be
 slight.
 Thus principled, and acting accordingly, what a wretch must that husband
 be, who could treat such a wife brutally!--Will Lovelace's wife be the
 only person to whom he will not pay the grateful debt of civility and
 good manners? He is allowed to be brave: Who ever knew a brave man, if a
 brave man of sense, an universally base man? And how much the gentleness
 of our sex, and the manner of our training up and education, make us
 need the protection of the brave, and the countenance of the generous,
 let the general approbation, which we are all so naturally inclined to
 give to men of that character, testify.
