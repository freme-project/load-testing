I took to a new one: to maintain a lady handsomely in her lying-in: to
 provide for the little-one, if it lived, according to the degree of its
 mother: to go into mourning for the mother, if she died. And the promise
 of this was a great comfort to the pretty dears, as they grew near their
 times.
 All my errors, all my expenses, have been with and upon women. So I
 could acquit my conscience (acting thus honourably by them) as well as
 my discretion as to point of fortune.
 All men love women--and find me a man of more honour, in these points,

 No wonder the sex love me as they do!
 But now I am strictly virtuous. I am reformed. So I have been for a

 I have contrived to see the boy twice, unknown to the aunt who
 takes care of him; loves him; and would not now part with him on any

 care of him. He will have his mother's fortune. They curse the father,
 ungrateful wretches! but bless the boy--Upon the whole, there is nothing
 vile in this matter on my side--a great deal on the Bettertons.
 Wherefore, Joseph, be not thou in pain, either for my head, or for thy
