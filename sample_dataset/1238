 I will hasten to deposit this. Then I will, for the last time, go to the
 usual place, in hopes to find that he has got my letter. If he has, I
 will not meet him. If he has not, I will take it back, and shew him what
 I have written. That will break the ice, as I may say, and save me much

 pretence for the intended evil of Wednesday next.
 Perhaps I shall not be able to write again one while. Perhaps not till

 be, while I have my senses.
 If your servant find nothing from me by Wednesday morning, you may then
 conclude that I can neither write to you, nor receive your favours.
 In that case, pity and pray for me, my beloved friend; and continue to
 me that place in your affection, which is the pride of my life, and the
 only comfort left to
 Your CL. HARLOWE.

 you?--You will soon hear (if already you have not heard from the mouth
 of common fame) that your Clarissa Harlowe is gone off with a man!
 I am busying myself to give you the particulars at large. The whole

 be employed in it till it is finished: every one of the hours, I mean,
 that will be spared me by this interrupting man, to whom I have made
