This is not an honourable way of proceeding in Mr. Lovelace. Did
 he learn this infamous practice of corrupting the servants of other

 'He begs, that I will not deny him making a visit to Mr. Solmes. By
 all that's good, he vows, that it shall not be with the least intention
 either to hurt or affront him; but only to set before him, calmly and
