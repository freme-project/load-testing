either to her education, or fine sense.
 Since, then, it is too evident, that she cannot esteem me; and since, as
 I have heard it justly observed by the excellent Miss Clarissa Harlowe,
 that love is not a voluntary passion; would it not be ungenerous to
 subject the dear daughter to the displeasure of a mother so justly fond
 of her; and you, Madam, while you are so good as to interest yourself in
 my favour, to uneasiness? And why, were I even to be sure, at last, of
 succeeding by means of your kind partiality to me, should I wish to make
 the best-beloved of my soul unhappy; since mutual must be our happiness,
 or misery for life the consequence to both?
 My best wishes will for ever attend the dear, the ever-dear lady! may
 her nuptials be happy! they must be so, if she marry the man she can
 honour with her love. Yet I will say, that whoever be the happy, the
 thrice-happy man, he can never love her with a passion more ardent and
 more sincere than mine.
 Accept, dear Madam, of my most grateful thanks for a distinction that
 has been the only support of my presumption in an address I am obliged,
 as utterly hopeless, to discontinue. A distinction, on which (and not
 on my own merits) I had entirely relied; but which, I find, can avail me
 nothing. To the last hour of my life, it will give me pleasure to think,
 that had your favour, your recommendation, been of sufficient weight to
 conquer what seems to be an invincible aversion, I had been the happiest
 of men.
 I am, dear Madam, with inviolable respect, your ever obliged and
 faithful humble servant, CHARLES HICKMAN.

 MRS. HOWE, TO CHARLES HICKMAN, ESQ. THURSDAY, MARCH 30.
 I cannot but say, Mr. Hickman, but you have cause to be dissatisfied--to
 be out of humour--to be displeased--with Nancy--but, upon my word; but
 indeed--What shall I say?--Yet this I will say, that you good young
