 But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
 tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.  My father made no reproach

 oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful
 degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow
 creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.  Sometimes I grew alarmed
 at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose
 alone sustained me:  my labours would soon end, and I believed that
 exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I
 promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.

 open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
 How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
