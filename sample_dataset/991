 ODE TO WISDOM BY A LADY
      The solitary bird of night
      Thro' thick shades now wings his flight,
         And quits his time-shook tow'r;
      Where, shelter'd from the blaze of day,
      In philosophic gloom he lay,
         Beneath his ivy bow'r.

      Which midnight echoes waft around,
         And sighing gales repeat.

      Nor sport her gaily colour'd dyes,
         As in the beam of day.
      O Pallas! queen of ev'ry art,
      That glads the sense, and mends the heart,
         Blest source of purer joys!
      In ev'ry form of beauty bright,
      That captivates the mental sight
         With pleasure and surprise;
      To thy unspotted shrine I bow:
      Attend thy modest suppliant's vow,
