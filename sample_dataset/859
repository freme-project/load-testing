 LETTER XXXIV
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, MARCH 17.
 I receive, with great pleasure, the early and cheerful assurances of
 your loyalty and love. And let our principal and most trusty friends
 named in my last know that I do.
 I would have thee, Jack, come down, as soon as thou canst. I believe I
 shall not want the others so soon. Yet they may come down to Lord M.'s.
 I will be there, if not to receive them, to satisfy my lord, that there

 relation, to be provided for by thy interest above--I mean not in
 Heaven, thou mayest be sure. Thou wilt find me at a little alehouse,
 they call it an inn; the White Hart, most terribly wounded, (but by
 the weather only,) the sign: in a sorry village, within five miles from
 Harlowe-place. Every body knows Harlowe-place, for, like Versailles, it
 is sprung up from a dunghill, within every elderly person's remembrance.
 Every poor body, particularly, knows it: but that only for a few years
 past, since a certain angel has appeared there among the sons and
 daughters of men.
 The people here at the Hart are poor, but honest; and have gotten it
 into their heads, that I am a man of quality in disguise; and there is
 no reining-in their officious respect. Here is a pretty little
 smirking daughter, seventeen six days ago. I call her my Rose-bud. Her
 grandmother (for there is no mother), a good neat old woman, as ever
