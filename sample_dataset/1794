And, if you like not this treatment, you may have worse, Sir!
 Ah! Jack! Jack!  What man, who has observed these things, either implied
 or expressed, in other families, would wish to be a husband!
 Dorcas found this paper in one of the drawers of her lady's dressing-
 table.  She was reperusing it, as she supposes, when the honest wench
 carried my message to desire her to favour me at the tea-table; for she
 saw her pop a paper into the drawer as she came in; and there, on her
 mistress's going to meet me in the dining-room, she found it; and to be
 this.
 But I had better not to have had a copy of it, as far as I know: for,
 determined as I was before upon my operations, it instantly turned all my
 resolutions in her favour.  Yet I would give something to be convinced
 that she did not pop it into her drawer before the wench, in order for me
 to see it; and perhaps (if I were to take notice of it) to discover
 whether Dorcas, according to Miss Howe's advice, were most my friend, or
 her's.
 The very suspicion of this will do her no good: for I cannot bear to be
 artfully dealt with.  People love to enjoy their own peculiar talents in
 monopoly, as arguments against me in her behalf.  But I know every tittle
 thou canst say upon it.  Spare therefore thy wambling nonsense, I desire
 thee; and leave this sweet excellence and me to our fate: that will
 determine for us, as it shall please itself: for as Cowley says,
         An unseen hand makes all our moves:
         And some are great, and some are small;
       Some climb to good, some from great fortunes fall:
         Some wise men, and some fools we call:
       Figures, alas! of speech!--For destiny plays us all.
 But, after all, I am sorry, almost sorry (for how shall I do to be quite
 sorry, when it is not given to me to be so?) that I cannot, until I have
 made further trials, resolve upon wedlock.
