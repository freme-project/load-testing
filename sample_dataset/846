in the light he appears to me, has no one merit; and who, knowing this
 aversion, could not persevere as he does, if he had the spirit of a man.
 If, Sir, you can think of the contents of this letter reasonable, I
 beseech you to support them with your interest. If not--I shall be most
 unhappy!--Nevertheless, it is but just in me so to write, as that Mr.
 Solmes may know what he has to trust to.
 Forgive, dear Sir, this tedious letter; and suffer it to have weight
 with you; and you will for ever oblige
 Your dutiful and affectionate niece,
 CL. HARLOWE.
 MR. ANTONY HARLOWE, TO MISS CL. HARLOWE
 NIECE CLARY,
 You had better not write to us, or to any of us. To me, particularly,
 you had better never to have set pen to paper, on the subject whereon
 you have written. He that is first in his own cause, saith the wise man,
 seemeth just: but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. And so, in
 this respect, I will be your neighbour: for I will search your heart to
 the bottom; that is to say, if your letter be written from your heart.
 Yet do I know what a task I have undertaken, because of the knack you
 are noted for at writing. But in defence of a father's authority, in
 behalf of the good, and honour, and prosperity of the family one comes
 of, what a hard thing it would be, if one could not beat down all the
 arguments a rebel child (how loth I am to write down that word of Miss
 Clary Harlowe!) can bring, in behalf of her obstinacy!
 In the first place, don't you declare (and that contrary to your
 declarations to your mother, remember that, girl!) that you prefer the
 man we all hate, and who hates us as bad!--Then what a character have
 you given of a worthy man! I wonder you dare write so freely of one we
 all respect--but possibly it may be for that very reason.
 How you begin your letter!--Because I value Mr. Solmes as my friend, you
