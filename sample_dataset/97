pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
 at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
 that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
 a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,
 either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the
 window, unable to bear these emotions.
 "Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
 load of wood.  The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of
 his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on
 the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,
 and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.  She seemed
 pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she
 placed in water, and then upon the fire.  She afterwards continued her
 work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily
 employed in digging and pulling up roots.  After he had been employed
 thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the
 cottage together.
 "The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance
 of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to
 eat.  The meal was quickly dispatched.  The young woman was again
 occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the
 cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
 Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent
 creatures.  One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming
 with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his
 figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his
 eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.  The
 old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different
 from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the
 fields.
