will. To offer to give up your estate!--That would not I have done! You
 see this offer staggered them: they took time to consider of it. They
 made my heart ache in the time they took. I was afraid they would have
 taken you at your word: and so, but for shame, and for fear of Lovelace,
 I dare say they would. You are too noble for them. This, I repeat, is an
 offer I would not have made. Let me beg of you, my dear, never to repeat

 almost half a century in a man of his constitution. But nevertheless I
 am very far from blaming you for your resentment.

 I shall be all impatience to know how this matter ends between you and
