I sent this down: my uncle was not gone: and he now stays to know the
 result of the question put to me in the enclosed answer which he has

 Your going to your uncle's was absolutely concluded upon for next
 Thursday. Nevertheless, your mother, seconded by Mr. Solmes, pleaded
 so strongly to have you indulged, that your request for a delay will
 be complied with, upon one condition; and whether for a fortnight, or
 a shorter time, that will depend upon yourself. If you refuse the

 intercession for you.--Nor do you deserve this favour, as you put it
 upon our yielding to you, not you to us.
 This condition is, that you admit of a visit from Mr. Solmes, for one
 hour, in company of your brother, your sister, or your uncle Antony,
 choose who you will.
 If you comply not, go next Thursday to a house which is become strangely
 odious to you of late, whether you get ready to go or not. Answer
 therefore directly to the point. No evasion. Name your day and hour. Mr.
 Solmes will neither eat you, nor drink you. Let us see, whether we are
 to be complied with in any thing, or not.
