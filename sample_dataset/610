"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.
 Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not
 possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the
 matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that
 he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
 outbreak?"
 
 "That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is
 the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a
 nice household for a young lady."
 
 "But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
 
 "Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what
 makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when
 they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some
 strong reason behind."
 
 "I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would
 understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so
 much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
 
 "Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that
 your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
 come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel
 about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt
 or in danger--"
 
 "Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
