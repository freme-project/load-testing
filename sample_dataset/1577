fixed at last by my example and conversation.
 He has given me an entertaining account of the four gentlemen he is to
 meet to-morrow night.--Entertaining, I mean for his humourous description
 of their persons, manners, &c. but such a description as is far from
 being to their praise.  Yet he seemed rather to design to divert my
 melancholy by it than to degrade them.  I think at bottom, my dear, that
 he must be a good-natured man; but that he was spoiled young, for want
 of check or controul.
 I cannot but call this, my circumstances considered, an happy day to the
 end of it.  Indeed, my dear, I think I could prefer him to all the men I
 ever knew, were he but to be always what he has been this day.  You see
 how ready I am to own all you have charged me with, when I find myself
 out.  It is a difficult thing, I believe, sometimes, for a young creature
 that is able to deliberate with herself, to know when she loves, or when
 she hates: but I am resolved, as much as possible, to be determined both
 in my hatred and love by actions, as they make the man worthy or unworthy.
 [She dates again Monday, and declares herself highly displeased at Miss
    Partington's being introduced to her: and still more for being obliged
    to promise to be present at Mr. Lovelace's collation.  She foresees,
    she says, a murder'd evening.]
 LETTER VII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 MONDAY NIGHT, MAY 1.
 I have just escaped from a very disagreeable company I was obliged, so
 much against my will, to be in.  As a very particular relation of this
 evening's conversation would be painful to me, you must content yourself
 with what you shall be able to collect from the outlines, as I may call
 them, of the characters of the persons; assisted by the little histories
 Mr. Lovelace gave me of each yesterday.
 The names of the gentlemen are Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and Belford.
