She accordingly flamed out in a raised tone: and this brought my cousin
 Dolly in to us. Miss Harlowe, your company is desired.
 I will come presently, cousin Dolly.
 But again provoking a severity from me which she could not bear, and
 calling me names! in once more come Dolly, with another message, that
 her company was desired.
 Not mine, I doubt, Miss Dolly, said I.
 The sweet-tempered girl burst out into tears, and shook her head.
 Go in before me, child, said Bella, [vexed to see her concern for me,]
 with thy sharp face like a new moon: What dost thou cry for? is it to
 make thy keen face look still keener?
 I believe Bella was blamed, too, when she went in; for I heard her say,
 the creature was so provoking, there was no keeping a resolution.
 Mr. Solmes, after a little while, came in again by himself, to take
 leave of me: full of scrapes and compliments; but too well tutored and
 encouraged, to give me hope of his declining his suit. He begged me
 not to impute to him any of the severe things to which he had been a
 sorrowful witness. He besought my compassion, as he called it.
 He said, the result was, that he still had hopes given him; and,
 although discouraged by me, he was resolved to persevere, while I
 remained single.--And such long and such painful services he talked of,
 as never before were heard of.
 I told him in the strongest manner, what he had to trust to.
 Yet still he determined to persist.--While I was no man's else, he must
 hope.
 What! said I, will you still persist, when I declare, as I do now, that
 my affections are engaged?--And let my brother make the most of it.
 He knew my principles, and adored me for them. He doubted not, that it
 was in his power to make me happy: and he was sure I would not want the
 will to be so.
