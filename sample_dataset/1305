moon-light. He'll not mind waiting for you. I choose not to send by any
 of Mr. Hickman's servants--at present, however. Every hour is now,
 or may be, important; and may make an alteration in your resolutions
 necessary.
 I hear at this instant, my mother calling about her, and putting every
 body into motion. She will soon, I suppose, make me and my employment
 the subjects of her inquiry.
 Adieu, my dear. May heaven preserve you, and restore you with honour as
 unsullied as your mind to
 Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER IX
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 13.
 I am infinitely concerned, my ever dear and ever kind friend, that I am
 the sad occasion of the displeasure between your mother and you.--How
 many persons have I made unhappy.
 Had I not to console myself, that my error is not owing to wicked
 precipitation, I should be the most miserable of all creatures. As it
 is, I am enough punished in the loss of my character, more valuable
 to me than my life; and in the cruel doubts and perplexities which,
 conflicting with my hopes, and each getting the victory by turns, harrow
 up my soul between them.
 I think, however, that you should obey your mother, and decline a
 correspondence with me; at least for the present. Take care how you
 fall into my error; for that begun with carrying on a prohibited
 correspondence; a correspondence which I thought it in my power to
 discontinue at pleasure. My talent is scribbling; and I the readier fell
 into this freedom, as I found delight in writing; having motives too,
 which I thought laudable; and, at one time, the permission of all my
 friends; to write to him.*
