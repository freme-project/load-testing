sister, that I should not have taken this liberty with my dear friend,
 notwithstanding I know you never loved them, had you not made so light
 of so shocking a transaction where a brother's life was at stake: when
 his credit in the eye of the mischievous sex has received a still deeper
 wound than he personally sustained; and when a revival of the same
 wicked resentments (which may end more fatally) is threatened.
 His credit, I say, in the eye of the mischievous sex: Who is not
 warranted to call it so; when it is re (as the two libertines his
 companions gloried) to resolve never to give a challenge; and among whom
 duelling is so fashionable a part of brutal bravery, that the man of

 a loss so to behave as to avoid incurring either a mortal guilt, or a
 general contempt?
 To enlarge a little upon this subject, May we not infer, that those who

 injury? Were I a man, methinks, I should have too much scorn for a
 person, who could wilfully do me a mean wrong, to put a value upon his
 life, equal to what I put upon my own. What an absurdity, because a man
 had done me a small injury, that I should put it in his power (at least,
 to an equal risque) to do me, and those who love me, an irreparable

 be room for resentment.
 How willingly would I run away from myself, and what most concerns
 myself, if I could! This digression brings me back again to the occasion
 of it--and that to the impatience I was in, when I ended my last
 letter, for my situation is not altered. I renew, therefore, my former
 earnestness, as the new day approaches, and will bring with it perhaps
