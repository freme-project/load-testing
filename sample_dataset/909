against the attempts of more ungovernable spirits, the peace and union
 of her family.
 But you know the terms. Come not near us, if you have resolve to be
 undutiful: but this, after what I have written, I hope you cannot be.
 If you come directly, and, as I have said, cheerfully, as if your heart
 were in your duty, (and you told me it was free, you know,) I shall
 then, as I said, give you the most tender proofs how much I am
 Your truly affectionate Mother.
 Think for me, my dearest friend, how I must be affected by this letter;
 the contents of it is so surprisingly terrifying, yet so sweetly
 urged!--O why, cried I to myself, am I obliged to undergo this
 severe conflict between a command that I cannot obey, and language so
 condescendingly moving!--Could I have been sure of being struck dead
 at the alter before the ceremony had given the man I hate a title to my
 vows, I think I could have submitted to having been led to it. But to
 think of living with and living for a man one abhors, what a sad thing
 is that!
 And then, how could the glare of habit and ornament be supposed any
 inducement to one, who has always held, that the principal view of a
 good wife in the adorning of her person, ought to be, to preserve the
 affection of her husband, and to do credit to his choice; and that she
 should be even fearful of attracting the eyes of others?--In this view,
 must not the very richness of the patterns add to my disgusts?--Great
 encouragement, indeed, to think of adorning one's self to be the wife of
 Mr. Solmes!
 Upon the whole, it was not possible for me to go down upon the
 prescribed condition. Do you think it was?--And to write, if my letter
 would have been read, what could I write that would be admitted, and
 after what I had written and said to so little effect?
 I walked backward and forward. I threw down with disdain the patterns.
