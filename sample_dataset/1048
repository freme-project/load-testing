I was willing to reward myself for the patience she had made me
 exercise, by getting at what intelligence I could from her.
 Why, Miss, seating herself at a little distance (excuse my sitting down)
 with the snuff-box tapped very smartly, the lid opened, and a
 pinch taken with a dainty finger and thumb, the other three fingers
 distendedly bent, and with a fine flourish--I cannot but say, that it is
 my opinion, you will certainly go on Thursday; and this noless foless,
 as I have heard my young lady say in FRENCH.
 Whether I am willing or not willing, you mean, I suppose, Mrs. Betty?
 You have it, Miss.
 Well but, Betty, I have no mind to be turned out of doors so suddenly.
 Do you think I could not be permitted to tarry one week longer?
 How can I tell, Miss?
 O Mrs. Betty, you can tell a great deal, if you please. But here I am
 forbid writing to any one of my family; none of it now will come near
 me; nor will any of it permit me to see them: How shall I do to make
 known my request, to stay here a week or fortnight longer?
 Why, Miss, I fancy, if you were to shew a compliable temper, your
 friends would shew a compliable one too. But would you expect favours,
 and grant none?
 Smartly put, Betty! But who knows what may be the result of my being
 carried to my uncle Antony's?
 Who knows, Miss!--Why any body will guess what may be the result.
 As how, Betty?
 As how! repeated the pert wench, Why, Miss, you will stand in your own
 light, as you have hitherto done: and your parents, as such good parents
 ought, will be obeyed.
 If, Mrs. Betty, I had not been used to your oughts, and to have my duty
 laid down to me by your oraculous wisdom I should be apt to stare at the
 liberty of you speech.
