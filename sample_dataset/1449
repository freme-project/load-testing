acknowledged warmth and quickness of your temper which your own good
 sense taught you to be apprehensive of. What though I have so miserably
 fallen, and am unhappy, if ever I had any judgment worth regarding, it
 is now as much worth as ever, because I can give it as freely against
 myself as against any body else. And shall I not, when there seems to be
 an infection in my fault, and that it leads you likewise to resolve to

 spring?
 The mind that can glory in being capable of so noble, so firm, so
 unshaken friendship, as that of my dear Miss Howe; a friendship which

 forfeited it? A prejudice in favour is as hard to be totally overcome as
 a prejudice in disfavour. In what a strong light, then, must that error
