SUNDAY, MAY 14.
 I have not been able to avoid a short debate with Mr. Lovelace.  I had
 ordered a coach to the door.  When I had noticed that it was come, I went

 fit for any of your relations for a few days?--And Mrs. Fretchville has
 taken more time too!--Then, pushing by him, I hurried down stairs.
 He called to Dorcas to bring him his sword and hat; and following me down
 into the passage, placed himself between me and the door; and again
