Your kind, your generous endeavours to interest your mother in my
 behalf, will, I hope, prevent those harsher extremities to which I might
 be otherwise driven. And to you I will fly, if permitted, and keep all
 my promises, of not corresponding with any body, not seeing any body,
 but by your mother's direction and yours.
 I will close and deposit at this place. It is not necessary to say, how
 much I am
 Your ever affectionate and obliged CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXXII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 I am glad my papers are safe in your hands. I will make it my endeavour
 to deserve your good opinion, that I may not at once disgrace your
 judgment, and my own heart.
 I have another letter from Mr. Lovelace. He is extremely apprehensive of
 the meeting I am to have with Mr. Solmes to-morrow. He says, 'that the
 airs that wretch gives himself on the occasion add to his concern; and
 it is with infinite difficulty that he prevails upon himself not to make
 him a visit to let him know what he may expect, if compulsion be used
 towards me in his favour. He assures me, that Solmes has actually talked
 with tradesmen of new equipages, and names the people in town with whom
 he has treated: that he has even' [Was there ever such a horrid wretch!]
 'allotted this and that apartment in his house, for a nursery, and other
 offices.'
 How shall I bear to hear such a creature talk of love to me? I shall be
 out of all patience with him. Besides, I thought that he did not dare
 to make or talk of these impudent preparations.--So inconsistent as such
 are with my brother's views--but I fly the subject.
 Upon this confidence of Solmes, you will less wonder at that of
 Lovelace, 'in pressing me in the name of all his family, to escape
 from so determined a violence as is intended to be offered to me at my
