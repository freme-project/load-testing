LETTER XLII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]
 But this subject must not be pursued. Another might, with more pleasure,
 (though not with more approbation,) upon one of your lively excursions.
 It is upon the high airs you give yourself upon the word approve.
 How comes it about, I wonder, that a young lady so noted for
 predominating generosity, should not be uniformly generous? That your
 generosity should fail in an instance where policy, prudence, gratitude,

 sink at once into silence the moment you came into company.
 I have told you of this before: and I believe I hinted to you once,
 that the superciliousness you put on only to him, was capable of a

 it, to make him shine--while a confident man, who, to be confident,
 must think as meanly of his company as highly of himself, enters with
 magisterial airs upon any subject; and, depending upon his assurance to
 bring himself off when found out, talks of more than he is master of.
 But a modest man!--O my dear, shall not a modest woman distinguish and
 wish to consort with a modest man?--A man, before whom, and to whom she
 may open her lips secure of his good opinion of all she says, and of his
 just and polite regard for her judgment? and who must therefore inspire
