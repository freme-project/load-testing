information--Still the less perhaps as I love writing; and those who do,
 are fond, you know, of occasions to use the pen: And then, having
 ever one's consent, and my uncle Hervey's desire that I would write,
 I thought that if I had been the only scrupulous person, it would have
 shewn a particularity that a vain man might construe to his advantage;
 and which my sister would not fail to animadvert upon.
 You have seen some of these letters; and have been pleased with this
 account of persons, places, and things; and we have both agreed, that he
 was no common observer upon what he had seen.
 My sister allowed that the man had a tolerable knack of writing and
 describing: And my father, who had been abroad in his youth, said, that
 his remarks were curious, and shewed him to be a person of reading,
 judgment and taste.
 Thus was a kind of correspondence begun between him and me, with general
 approbation; while every one wondered at, and was pleased with, his
 patient veneration of me; for so they called it. However, it was not
 doubted but he would soon be more importunate, since his visits were
 more frequent, and he acknowledged to my aunt Hervey a passion for me,
 accompanied with an awe that he had never known before; to which he
 attributed what he called his but seeming acquiescence with my father's
 pleasure, and the distance I kept him at. And yet, my dear, this may be
 his usual manner of behaviour to our sex; for had not my sister at first
 all his reverence?
 Mean time, my father, expecting his importunity, kept in readiness the
 reports he had heard in his disfavour, to charge them upon him then, as
 so many objections to address. And it was highly agreeable to me that he
 did so: it would have been strange if it were not; since the person who
 could reject Mr. Wyerley's address for the sake of his free opinions,
 must have been inexcusable, had she not rejected another's for his freer
 practices.
