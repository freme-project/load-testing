that secret. He is indeed himself, as I may say, that secret! What an
 intimacy does this beget for the lover! How is it distancing the parent!
 Yet who, as things are situated, can blame you?--Your condescension has
 no doubt hitherto prevented great mischiefs. It must be continued,
 for the same reasons, while the cause remains. You are drawn in by
 a perverse fate against inclination: but custom, with such
 laudable purposes, will reconcile the inconveniency, and make an
 inclination.--And I would advise you (as you would wish to manage on an
 occasion so critical with that prudence which governs all your actions)
 not to be afraid of entering upon a close examination into the true
 springs and grounds of this your generosity to that happy man.
 It is my humble opinion, I tell you frankly, that on inquiry it will
 come out to be LOVE--don't start, my dear!--Has not your man himself had
 natural philosophy enough to observe already to your aunt Hervey, that
 love takes the deepest root in the steadiest minds? The deuce take his
 sly penetration, I was going to say; for this was six or seven weeks
 ago.
 I have been tinctured, you know. Nor on the coolest reflection, could
 I account how and when the jaundice began: but had been over head and
 ears, as the saying is, but for some of that advice from you, which I
 now return you. Yet my man was not half so--so what, my dear--to be sure
 Lovelace is a charming fellow. And were he only--but I will not make
 you glow, as you read--upon my word I will not.--Yet, my dear, don't you
 find at your heart somewhat unusual make it go throb, throb, throb, as
 you read just here?--If you do, don't be ashamed to own it--it is your
 generosity, my love, that's all.--But as the Roman augur said, Caesar,
 beware of the Ides of March!
 Adieu, my dearest friend.--Forgive, and very speedily, by the new found
 expedient, tell me that you forgive,
 Your ever-affectionate, ANNA HOWE.
