roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person
 it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.
 Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to
 weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
 IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
 Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
 Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,
 there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
 notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel
 Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a
 finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was

 it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it
 gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
 reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story
 has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,
 like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when
 set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
 facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears
 gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
 on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
 deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly

 It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the
 events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned
 to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker
