     At their alighting at the inn at St. Alban's on Monday
      night, thus he writes:
 The people who came about us, as we alighted, seemed by their jaw-fallen
 faces, and goggling eyes, to wonder at beholding a charming young lady,
 majesty in her air and aspect, so composedly dressed, yet with features
 so discomposed, come off a journey which made the cattle smoke, and the
 servants sweat. I read their curiosity in their faces, and my beloved's
 uneasiness in her's. She cast a conscious glance, as she alighted, upon
 her habit, which was no habit; and repulsively, as I may say, quitting
 my assisting hand, hurried into the house.*****
 Ovid was not a greater master of metamorphoses than thy friend. To the
 mistress of the house I instantly changed her into a sister, brought off
 by surprise from a near relation's, (where she had wintered,) to prevent
 her marrying a confounded rake, [I love always to go as near the truth
 as I can,] whom her father and mother, her elder sister, and all her
 loving uncles, aunts, and cousins abhorred. This accounted for my
 charmer's expected sullens; for her displeasure when she was to join me
 again, were it to hold; for her unsuitable dress upon the road; and,
 at the same time, gave her a proper and seasonable assurance of my
 honourable views.
 Upon the debate between the lady and him, and particularly upon that
 part   where she upbraids him with putting a young creature upon making a
    sacrifice of her duty and conscience, he write:
 All these, and still more mortifying things, she said.
 I heard her in silence. But when it came to my turn, I pleaded, I
 argued, I answered her, as well as I could.--And when humility would
 not do, I raised my voice, and suffered my eyes to sparkle with anger;
 hoping to take advantage of that sweet cowardice which is so amiable in
 the sex, and to which my victory over this proud beauty is principally
 owing.
