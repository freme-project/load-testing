Upon the whole: were I inclined to plead for her, it is now the most
 improper of all times.  Now that my brother Harlowe has discouraged (as
 he last night came hither on purpose to tell us) Mr. Hickman's insinuated
 application; and been applauded for it.  Now, that my brother Antony is
 intending to carry his great fortune, through her fault, into another
 family:--she expecting, no doubt, herself to be put into her
 grandfather's estate, in consequence of a reconciliation, and as a reward
 for her fault: and insisting still upon the same terms which she offered
 before, and which were rejected--Not through my fault, I am sure,
 rejected!
 From all these things you will return such an answer as the case
 requires.  It might cost me the peace of my whole life, at this time, to
 move for her.  God forgive her!  If I do, nobody else will.  And let it,
 for your own sake, as well as mine, be a secret that you and I have
 entered upon this subject.  And I desire you not to touch upon it again
 but by particular permission: for, O my dear, good woman, it sets my
 heart a bleeding in as many streams as there are veins in it!
 Yet think me not impenetrable by a proper contrition and remorse--But
 what a torment is it to have a will without a power!
 Adieu! adieu!  God give us both comfort; and to the once dear--the ever-
 dear creature (for can a mother forget her child?) repentance, deep
 repentance! and as little suffering as may befit his blessed will, and
 her grievous fault, prays
 Your real friend,
 CHARLOTTE HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXIX
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE
 SUNDAY, MAY 14.
 How it is now, my dear, between you and Mr. Lovelace, I cannot tell.
 But, wicked as the man is, I am afraid he must be your lord and master.
