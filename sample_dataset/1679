 You, my dear, have accused me of having modesty'd away, as you phrase it,
 several opportunities of being--Being what, my dear?--Why, the wife of a
 libertine: and what a libertine and his wife are my cousin Morden's
 letter tells us.--Let me here, once for all, endeavour to account for the
 motives of behavior to this man, and for the principles I have proceeded
