his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
 probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
 difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
 married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
 flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
 the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
 Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
 interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
 of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
 Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
