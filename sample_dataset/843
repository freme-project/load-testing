displeasure, if I say, what all who know me have reason to think (and
 some have upbraided me for), that I despise those motives. Dear, dear
 Sir, what are settlements to one who has as much of her own as she
 wishes for?--Who has more in her own power, as a single person, than
 it is probable she would be permitted to have at her disposal, as a
 wife?--Whose expenses and ambition are moderate; and who, if she had
 superfluities, would rather dispense them to the necessitous, than lay
 them by her useless? If then such narrow motives have so little weight
 with me for my own benefit, shall the remote and uncertain view of
 family-aggrandizements, and that in the person of my brother and his
 descendents, be thought sufficient to influence me?
 Has the behaviour of that brother to me of late, or his consideration

 choose to hazard a life so justly precious as an only son's, rather than
 not ratify passions which he is above attempting to subdue, and, give me
 leave to say, has been too much indulged in, either with regard to his
 own good, or the peace of any body related to him;) Has his behaviour, I
 say, deserved of me in particular, that I should make a sacrifice of my

 formed upon chimerical, at least upon unlikely, contingencies; as I will
 undertake to demonstrate, if I may be permitted to examine it?
 I am afraid you will condemn my warmth: But does not the occasion
 require it? To the want of a greater degree of earnestness in my
 opposition, it seems, it is owing, that such advances have been made,
 as have been made. Then, dear Sir, allow something, I beseech you, for a
 spirit raised and embittered by disgraces, which (knowing my own heart)
 I am confident to say, are unmerited.
 But why have I said so much, in answer to the supposed charge of
 prepossession, when I have declared to my mamma, as now, Sir, I do
 to you, that if it be not insisted upon that I shall marry any other
