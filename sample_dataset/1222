him!
 But, how, on this revocation of my appointment, shall I be able to
 pacify him?
 How!--Why assert the privilege of my sex!--Surely, on this side of the
 solemnity he has no right to be displeased. Besides, did I not reserve a
 power of receding, as I saw fit? To what purpose, as I asked in the case
 between your mother and you, has any body an option, if the making use
 of it shall give the refused a right to be disgusted?
 Far, very far, would those, who, according to the old law, have a right
 of absolving or confirming a child's promise, be from ratifying mine,
 had it been ever so solemn a one.* But this was rather an appointment
 than a promise: and suppose it had been the latter; and that I had not
 reserved to myself a liberty of revoking it; was it to preclude better
 or maturer consideration?--If so, how unfit to be given!--how ungenerous
 to be insisted upon!--And how unfitter still to be kept!--Is there a man
 living who ought to be angry that a woman whom he hopes one day to
 call his, shall refuse to keep a rash promise, when, on the maturest
 deliberation, she is convinced that it was a rash one?
      * See Numb. XXX. Where it is declared, whose vows shall be
      binding, and whose not. The vows of a man, or of a widow,
      are there pronounced to be indispensable; because they are
      sole, and subject to no other domestic authority. But the
      vows of a single woman, or of a wife, if the father of the
      one, or the husband of the other, disallow of them as soon
      as they know them, are to be of no force.
      A matter highly necessary to be known; by all young ladies
      especially, whose designing addressers too often endeavour
      to engage them by vows; and then plead conscience and honour
      to them to hold them down to the performance.
      It cannot be amiss to recite the very words.
