MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]
 I obliged the dear creature highly, I could perceive, by bringing Mrs.
 Greme to attend her, and to suffer that good woman's recommendation of
 lodgings to take place, on her refusal to go to The Lawn.
 She must believe all my views to be honourable, when I had provided for
 her no particular lodgings, leaving it to her choice, whether she would
 go to M. Hall, to The Lawn, to London, or to either of the dowagers of

 And then Mrs. Greme is a pious matron, and would not have been biased
 against truth on any consideration. She used formerly, while there were

 duties are reciprocal. But for Mrs. Greme, poor woman! when my lord
 has the gout, and is at The Lawn, and the chaplain not to be found, she
 prays by him, or reads a chapter to him in the Bible, or some other good
 book.
 Was it not therefore right to introduce such a good sort of woman to
