morning."
 
 By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
 old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers
 all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he
 threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal
 spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
 clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining
 very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,
 which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,
 away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and
 grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
 green of the new foliage.
 
 "Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
 enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
 
 But Holmes shook his head gravely.
 
 "Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of
 a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with
 reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered
 houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,
 and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
 isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
 there."
 
 "Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these
 dear old homesteads?"
