nonsense--confound his wisdom of nations, if so much of it is to be
 scraped together, in disgrace of itself, to make one egregious simpleton!
 --But I am glad I am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly,
 however; since, in all human affairs, the convenient are so mingled, that
 there is no having the one without the other.
 I have already offered the bill enclosed in it to my beloved; and read to
 her part of the letter.  But she refused the bill: and, as I am in cash
 myself, I shall return it.  She seemed very desirous to peruse the whole
 letter.  And when I told her, that, were it not for exposing the writer,
 I would oblige her, she said, it would not be exposing his Lordship to
 show it to her; and that she always preferred the heart to the head.  I
 knew her meaning; but did not thank her for it.
 All that makes for me in it I will transcribe for her--yet, hang it, she
 shall have the letter, and my soul with it, for one consenting kiss.
 She has got the letter from me without the reward.  Deuce take me, if I
 had the courage to propose the condition.  A new character this of
 bashfulness in thy friend.  I see, that a truly modest woman may make
 even a confident man keep his distance.  By my soul, Belford, I believe,
 that nine women in ten, who fall, fall either from their own vanity or
 levity, or for want of circumspection and proper reserves.
 I did intend to take my reward on her returning a letter so favourable
 to us both.  But she sent it to me, sealed up, by Dorcas.  I might have
 thought that there were two or three hints in it, that she would be too
 nice immediately to appear to.  I send it to thee; and here will stop,
 to give thee time to read it.  Return it as soon as thou hast perused it.

 It is a long lane that has no turning.--Do not despise me for my proverbs
