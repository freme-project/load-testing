to any but elemental controul, and even ready to buffet that, bluster
 often as violently as the winds they are accustomed to be angry at.
 I believe Mr. Solmes will look as much like a fool as I shall do, if it
 be true, as my uncle Harlowe writes, and as Betty often tells me, that
 he is as much afraid of seeing me, as I am of seeing him.
 Adieu, my happy, thrice-happy Miss Howe, who have no hard terms fixed
 to your duty!--Who have nothing to do, but to fall in with a choice your
 mother has made for you, to which you have not, nor can have, a just
 objection: except the frowardness of our sex, as our free censurers
 would perhaps take the liberty to say, makes it one, that the choice was
 your mother's, at first hand. Perverse nature, we know, loves not to
 be prescribed to; although youth is not so well qualified, either by
 sedateness or experience, to choose for itself.
 To know your own happiness, and that it is now, nor to leave it to after
 reflection to look back upon the preferable past with a heavy and self
 accusing heart, that you did not choose it when you might have chosen
 it, is all that is necessary to complete your felicity!--And this power
 is wished you by
 Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXX
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 2.
 I ought yesterday to have acknowledged the receipt of your parcel. Robin
 tells me, that the Joseph Leman, whom you mention as the traitor, saw
 him. He was in the poultry-yard, and spoke to Robin over the bank
 which divides that from the green-lane. 'What brings you hither, Mr.
 Robert?--But I can tell. Hie away, as fast as you can.'
 No doubt but their dependence upon this fellow's vigilance, and upon
 Betty's, leaves you more at liberty in your airings, than you would
 otherwise be. But you are the only person I ever heard of, who in such
 circumstances had not some faithful servant to trust little offices to.
