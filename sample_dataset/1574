be present at it.
 To be obliged to appear before my friends as what she was not!  She was
 for insisting, that I should acquaint the women here with the truth of
 the matter; and not go on propagating stories for her to countenance,
 making her a sharer in my guilt.
 But what points will not perseverance carry? especially when it is
 covered over with the face of yielding now, and, Parthian-like, returning
 to the charge anon.  Do not the sex carry all their points with their men
 by the same methods?  Have I conversed with them so freely as I have

 delight me with thy angry twirls, that thou temptest me not to provoke a
 variety of them from one, whose every motion, whose every air, carries in
 it so much sense and soul.
 But, angry or pleased, this charming creature must be all loveliness.
 Her features are all harmony, and made for one another.  No other feature
