for that of one of the widow Sorlings's daughters; and, above all, for
 that of Mrs. Norton; are agreeable counterbalances. Were it not for
 these circumstances, I should have said a great deal more of the other.
 Yet what a foolish fellow, to let you know over-night that he had such
 letters!--I can't tell what to make of him.
 I am pleased with the contents of these ladies' letters. And the more,
 as I have caused the family to be again sounded, and find that they are
 all as desirous as ever of your alliance.
 They really are (every one of them) your very great admirers. And as for
 Lord M., he is so much pleased with you, and with the confidence, as
 he calls it, which you have reposed in his nephew, that he vows he will
 disinherit him, if he reward it not as he ought. You must take care,
 that you lose not both families.
 I hear Mrs. Norton is enjoined, as she values the favour of the
 other family, not to correspond either with you or with me--Poor
 creatures!--But they are your--yet they are not your relations, neither,
 I believe. Had you had any other nurse, I should have concluded you had
 been changed. I suffer by their low malice--excuse me, therefore.
 You really hold this man to his good behaviour with more spirit than
 I thought you mistress of; especially when I judged of you by that
 meekness which you always contended for, as the proper distinction of
 the female character; and by the love, which (think as you please) you
 certainly have for him. You may rather be proud of than angry at the
 imputation; since you are the only woman I ever knew, read, or heard
 of, whose love was so much governed by her prudence. But when once the
 indifference of the husband takes place of the ardour of the lover, it
 will be your turn: and, if I am not mistaken, this man, who is the only
 self-admirer I ever knew who was not a coxcomb, will rather in his day
 expect homage than pay it.
 Your handsome husbands, my dear, make a wife's heart ache very often:
