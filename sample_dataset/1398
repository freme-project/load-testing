But you shall judge of him as I proceed. Only, if I any where appear
 to you to be credulous, I beg you to set me right: for you are a
 stander-by, as you say in a former*--Would to Heaven I were not to play!
 for I think, after all, I am held to a desperate game.

 Before I could finish my last to you, he sent up twice more to beg
 admittance. I returned for answer, that I would see him at my own time:
 I would neither be invaded nor prescribed to.
 Considering how we parted, and my delaying his audience, as he sometimes
 calls it, I expected him to be in no very good humour, when I admitted
 of his visit; and by what I wrote, you will conclude that I was not. Yet
 mine soon changed, when I saw his extreme humility at his entrance, and
 heard what he had to say.
 I have a letter, Madam, said he, from Lady Betty Lawrance, and another
 from my cousin Charlotte. But of these more by-and-by. I came now to
 make my humble acknowledgement to you upon the arguments that passed
 between us so lately.
 I was silent, wondering what he was driving at.
 I am a most unhappy creature, proceeded he: unhappy from a strange
 impatiency of spirit, which I cannot conquer. It always brings upon me
 deserved humiliation. But it is more laudable to acknowledge, than to
 persevere when under the power of conviction.
 I was still silent.
 I have been considering what you proposed to me, Madam, that I should
 acquiesce with such terms as you should think proper to comply with, in
 order to a reconciliation with your friends.
 Well, Sir.
 And I find all just, all right, on your side; and all impatience, all
 inconsideration on mine.
 I stared, you may suppose. Whence this change, Sir? and so soon?
