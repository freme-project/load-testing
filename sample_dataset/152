followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
 When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
 but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
 his destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
 consciousness of which haunted me.  I was guiltless, but I had indeed
 drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.
 I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
 have interested the most unfortunate being.  Clerval did not like it so
 well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing
 to him.  But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh,
 its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world,
 Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated
 him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But
 I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
 We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and
 along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
 But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
 their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
 accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
 alone.  "Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let this be our
 rendezvous.  I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
 my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
 time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
 congenial to your own temper."
 Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
 remonstrate.  He entreated me to write often.  "I had rather be with
 you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch
 people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return,
 that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
 your absence."
