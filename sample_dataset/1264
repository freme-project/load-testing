after a while, will be more studious to be reconciled to her than to get
 her back. So you will be a happy instrument of great good to all round.
 And this will one day be acknowledged by both families. You will then be
 every one's favourite; and every good servant, for the future, will be
 proud to be likened to honest Joseph Leman.
 If she should guess at you, or find you out, I have it already in my
 head to write a letter for you to copy,* which, occasionally produced,
 will set you right with her.
      * See Vol.III. Letter XXI.
 This one time be diligent, be careful: this will be the crown of all:
 and once more, depend, for a recompense, upon the honour of
 Your assured friend, R. LOVELACE.
 You need not be so much afraid of going too far with Betty. If you
 should make a match with her, she is a very likely creature, though
 a vixen, as you say. I have an admirable receipt to cure a termagant
 wife.--Never fear, Joseph, but thou shalt be master of thine house. If
 she be very troublesome, I can teach thee how to break her heart in a
 twelvemonth; and honestly too;--or the precept would not be mine.
 I enclose a new earnest of my future favour.
 LETTER IV
 TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQUIER, HIS HONNER SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.
 HONNERED SIR,
 I must confesse I am infinitely obliged to your Honner's bounty. But
 this last command!--It seems so intricket! Lord be merciful to me, how
 have I been led from littel stepps to grate stepps!--And if I should
 be found out!--But your Honner says you will take me into your Honner's
 sarvise, and protect me, if as I should at any time be found out;
 and raise my wages besides; or set me upp in a good inne; which is my
 ambishion. And you will be honnerable and kind to my dearest young lady,
 God love her.--But who can be unkind to she?
