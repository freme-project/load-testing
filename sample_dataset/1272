Betty's.
 No doubt of it, I replied, with such an indignation in my manner, as
 made him run over with professions, that he was far from proposing them,
 or wishing for my acceptance of them. And again he repeated, that my
 honour and safety were all he was solicitous about; assuring me, that my
 will should be a law to him in every particular.
 I was too peevish, and too much afflicted, and indeed too much incensed
 against him, to take well any thing he said.
 I thought myself, I said, extremely unhappy. I knew not what to
 determine upon: my reputation now, no doubt, utterly ruined: destitute
 of clothes: unfit to be seen by any body: my very indigence, as I might
 call it, proclaiming my folly to every one who saw me; who would suppose
 that I had been taken at advantage, or had given an undue one; and had
 no power over either my will or my actions: that I could not but think I
 had been dealt artfully with: that he had seemed to have taken, what he
 might suppose, the just measure of my weakness, founded on my youth and
 inexperience: that I could not forgive myself for meeting him: that my
 heart bled for the distresses of my father and mother, on this occasion:
 that I would give the world, and all my hopes in it, to have been still
 in my father's house, whatever had been my usage: that, let him protest
 and vow what he would, I saw something low and selfish in his love, that
 he could study to put a young creature upon making such a sacrifice of
 her duty and conscience: when a person, actuated by a generous love,
 must seek to oblige the object of it, in every thing essential to her
 honour, and to her peace of mind.
 He was very attentive to all I said, never offering to interrupt me
 once. His answer to every article, almost methodically, shewed his
 memory.
 'What I had said, he told me, made him very grave; and he would answer
 accordingly.
