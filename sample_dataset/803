judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge, have some reason for
 treating you as they do. It must have long been a mortification to

 'Lovelace entertained the company in his lively gay way, and made
 every body laugh at one of his stories. It was before this creature was
 thought of for you. Solmes laughed too. It was, however, his laugh: for
 his first three years, at least, I imagine, must have been one continual
 fit of crying; and his muscles have never yet been able to recover a
