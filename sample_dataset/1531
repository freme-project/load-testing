or an indecent picture; and if she has borne that, or only blushed, and
 not been angry; and more especially if she has leered and smiled; that
 girl have I, and old Satan, put down for our own. O how I could warn
 these little rogues, if I would! Perhaps envy, more than virtue, will
 put me upon setting up beacons for them, when I grow old and joyless.
 TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
 If you are in London when I get thither, you will see me soon. My
 charmer is a little better than she was: her eyes show it; and her
 harmonious voice, hardly audible last time I saw her, now begins to
 cheer my heart once more. But yet she has no love--no sensibility!
 There is no addressing her with those meaning, yet innocent freedoms
 (innocent, at first setting out, they may be called) which soften others
 of her sex. The more strange this, as she now acknowledges preferable
 favour for me; and is highly susceptible of grief. Grief mollifies,
 and enervates. The grieved mind looks round it, silently implores
 consolation, and loves the soother. Grief is ever an inmate with joy.
 Though they won't show themselves at the same window at one time; yet
 they have the whole house in common between them.
 LETTER LXII
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. WEDN. APRIL 26.
 At last my lucky star has directed us into the desired port, and we are
 safely landed.--Well says Rowe:--
       The wise and active conquer difficulties,
       By daring to attempt them.  Sloth and folly
       Shiver and shrink at sight of toil and hazard,
       And make th' impossibility they fear.
 But in the midst of my exultation, something, I know not what to call
 it, checks my joys, and glooms over my brighter prospects: if it be not
 conscience, it is wondrously like what I thought so, many, many years
 ago.
