I am equally earnest with her in this letter, as I was with my sister
 in that I wrote to her, to obtain for me a speedy reconciliation, that I
 not be further precipitated; intimating, 'That, by a timely lenity, all
 may pass for a misunderstanding only, which, otherwise, will be thought
 equally disgraceful to them, and to me; appealing to her for the
 necessity I was under to do what I did.'--
 Had I owned that I was overreached, and forced away against my
 intention, might they not, as a proof of the truth of my assertion, have
 insisted upon my immediate return to them? And, if I did not return,
 would they not have reason to suppose, that I had now altered my mind
 (if such were my mind) or had not the power to return?--Then were I
 to have gone back, must it not have been upon their own terms? No
 conditioning with a father! is a maxim with my father, and with my
 uncles. If I would have gone, Mr. Lovelace would have opposed it. So I
 must have been under his controul, or have run away from him, as it is
 supposed I did to him, from Harlowe-place. In what a giddy light would
 this have made me appear!--Had he constrained me, could I have
 appealed to my friends for their protection, without risking the very
 consequences, to prevent which (setting up myself presumptuously, as a
 middle person between flaming spirits,) I have run into such terrible
 inconveniencies.
 But, after all, must it not give me great anguish of mind, to be forced
 to sanctify, as I may say, by my seeming after-approbation, a measure
 I was so artfully tricked into, and which I was so much resolved not to
 take?
 How one evil brings on another, is sorrowfully witnessed to by
 Your ever-obliged and affectionate, CL. HARLOWE.

 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, APR. 14.
 Thou hast often reproached me, Jack, with my vanity, without
