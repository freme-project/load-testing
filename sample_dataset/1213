saved me from a very great inconvenience, as you must needs remember.
 But you were always for making excuses for other people, in cases
 wherein you would not have allowed of one for yourself.
 I must own, that were these excuses for a friend's indifference, or
 denial, made by any body but you, in a case of such vast importance to
 herself, and of so comparative a small one to those for whose protection
 she would be thought to wish; I, who am for ever, as you have often
 remarked, endeavouring to trace effects to their causes, should be
 ready to suspect that there was a latent, unowned inclination, which
 balancing, or preponderating rather, made the issue of the alternative
 (however important) sit more lightly upon the excuser's mind than she
 cared to own.
 You will understand me, my dear. But if you do not, it may be well for
 me; for I am afraid I shall have it from you for but starting such a
 notion, or giving a hint, which perhaps, as you did once in another
 case, you will reprimandingly call, 'Not being able to forego the
 ostentation of sagacity, though at the expense of that tenderness which
 is due to friendship and charity.'
 What signifies owning a fault without mending it, you'll say?--Very
 true, my dear. But you know I ever was a saucy creature--ever stood in
 need of great allowances.--And I remember, likewise, that I ever had
 them from my dear Clarissa. Nor do I doubt them now: for you know how
 much I love you--if it be possible, more than myself I love you! Believe
 me, my dear: and, in consequence of that belief, you will be able to
 judge how much I am affected by your present distressful and critical
 situation; which will not suffer me to pass by without a censure even
 that philosophy of temper in your own cause, which you have not in
 another's, and which all that know you ever admired you for.
 From this critical and distressful situation, it shall be my hourly
 prayers that you may be delivered without blemish to that fair fame
