message; although, as you will remember from my last, I was in a way
 before that wanted no additional surprises.
 Miss! Miss! Miss! cried she, as fast as she could speak, with her arms
 spread abroad, and all her fingers distended, and held up, will you be
 pleased to walk down into your own parlour?--There is every body, I will
 assure you in full congregation!--And there is Mr. Solmes, as fine as a
 lord, with a charming white peruke, fine laced shirt and ruffles, coat
 trimmed with silver, and a waistcoat standing on end with lace!--Quite
 handsome, believe me!--You never saw such an alteration!--Ah! Miss,
 shaking her head, 'tis pity you have said so much against him! but you
 will know how to come off for all that!--I hope it will not be too late!
 Impertinence! said I--Wert thou bid to come up in this fluttering
 way?--and I took up my fan, and fanned myself.
 Bless me! said she, how soon these fine young ladies will be put into
 flusterations!--I mean not either to offend or frighten you, I am
 sure.--
 Every body there, do you say?--Who do you call every body?
 Why, Miss, holding out her left palm opened, and with a flourish, and
 a saucy leer, patting it with the fore finger of the other, at every
 mentioned person, there is your papa!--there is your mamma!--there is
 your uncle Harlowe!--there is your uncle Antony!--your aunt Hervey!--my
 young lady!--and my young master!--and Mr. Solmes, with the air of a
 great courtier, standing up, because he named you:--Mrs. Betty, said he,
 [then the ape of a wench bowed and scraped, as awkwardly as I suppose
 the person did whom she endeavoured to imitate,] pray give my humble
 service to Miss, and tell her, I wait her commands.
 Was not this a wicked wench?--I trembled so, I could hardly stand. I was
 spiteful enough to say, that her young mistress, I supposed, bid her put
 on these airs, to frighten me out of a capacity of behaving so calmly as
 should procure me my uncles' compassion.
