one.
 If you ask me, my dear, how this caution befits me? let me tell you a
 secret which I have but very lately found out upon self-examination,
 although you seem to have made the discovery long ago: That had not my
 foolish eye been too much attached, I had not taken the pains to attempt,
 so officiously as I did, the prevention of mischief between him and some
 of my family, which first induced the correspondence between us, and was
 the occasion of bringing the apprehended mischief with double weight upon
 himself.  My vanity and conceit, as far as I know, might have part in the
 inconsiderate measure: For does it not look as if I thought myself more
 capable of obviating difficulties than anybody else of my family?
 But you must not, my dear, suppose my heart to be still a confederate
 with my eye.  That deluded eye now clearly sees its fault, and the misled
 heart despises it for it.  Hence the application I am making to my uncle:
 hence it is, that I can say (I think truly) that I would atone for my
 fault at any rate, even by the sacrifice of a limb or two, if that would
 Adieu, my dearest friend!--May your heart never know the hundredth part
 of the pain mine at present feels! prays
 Your
 CLARISSA HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXIII
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE
 WEDNESDAY, MAY 10.
 I WILL write!  No man shall write for me.*  No woman shall hinder me from
 writing.  Surely I am of age to distinguish between reason and caprice.
 I am not writing to a man, am I?--If I were carrying on a correspondence
 with a fellow, of whom my mother disapproved, and whom it might be
 improper for me to encourage, my own honour and my duty would engage my
 obedience.  But as the case is so widely different, not a word more on
 this subject, I beseech you!
