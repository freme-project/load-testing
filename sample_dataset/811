beforehand, I can tell you what he and what his sisters will say, when
 they are sounded. Who would not be proud of such a relation as Miss
 Clarissa Harlowe?--Mrs. Fortescue told me, that they are all your very
 great admirers.
 If I have not been clear enough in my advice about what you shall do,
 let me say, that I can give it in one word: it is only by re-urging you
 to RESUME. If you do, all the rest will follow.
 We are told here, that Mrs. Norton, as well as your aunt Hervey, has
 given her opinion on the implicit side of the question. If she can
 think, that the part she has had in your education, and your own
 admirable talents and acquirements, are to be thrown away upon such a
 worthless creature as Solmes, I could heartily quarrel with her. You may
 think I say this to lessen your regard for the good woman. And perhaps
 not wholly without cause, if you do. For, to own the truth, methinks,
 I don't love her so well as I should do, did you love her so apparently
 less, that I could be out of doubt, that you love me better.
 Your mother tells you, 'That you will have great trials: that you are
 under your father's discipline.'--The word is enough for me to despise
 them who give occasion for its use.--'That it is out of her power to
 help you!' And again: 'That if you have any favour to hope for, it must
 be by the mediation of your uncles.' I suppose you will write to the
 oddities, since you are forbid to see them. But can it be, that such a
 lady, such a sister, such a wife, such a mother, has no influence in her
 own family? Who, indeed, as you say, if this be so, would marry, that
 can live single? My choler is again beginning to rise. RESUME, my dear:
 and that is all I will give myself time to say further, lest I offend
 you when I cannot serve you--only this, that I am
 Your truly affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER XXVIII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY, MARCH 10.
