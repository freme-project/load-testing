persuade yourself to be Mrs. Solmes.
      * Letter I.
 I am pleased with the instances you give me of Mr. Lovelace's
 benevolence to his own tenants, and with his little gift to your
 uncle's. Mrs. Fortescue allows him to be the best of landlords: I might
 have told you that, had I thought it necessary to put you into some
 little conceit of him. He has qualities, in short, that may make him
 a tolerable creature on the other side of fifty: but God help the
 poor woman to whose lot he shall fall till then! women, I should say,
 perhaps; since he may break half-a-dozen hearts before that time.--But
 to the point I was upon--Shall we not have reason to commend the
 tenant's grateful honesty, if we are told, that with joy the poor man
 called out your uncle, and on the spot paid him in part of his debt
 those two guineas?--But what shall we say of that landlord, who, though
 he knew the poor man to be quite destitute, could take it; and, saying
 nothing while Mr. Lovelace staid, as soon as he was gone, tell of it in
 praise of the poor fellow's honesty?--Were this so, and were not that
 landlord related to my dearest friend, how should I despise such a
 wretch?--But, perhaps, the story is aggravated. Covetous people have
 every one's ill word: and so indeed they ought; because they are
 only solicitous to keep that which they prefer to every one's good
 one.--Covetous indeed would they be, who deserved neither, yet expected
 both!
 I long for your next letter. Continue to be as particular as possible.
 I can think of no other subject but what relates to you and to your
 affairs: for I am, and ever will be, most affectionately,
 Your own, ANNA HOWE.
