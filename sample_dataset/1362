He will have it, that the menaces which he threw out just now against my
 brother and Mr. Solmes, are only the effect of an unmeaning pleasantry.
 He has too great a stake in his country, he says, to be guilty of such
 enterprises as should lay him under a necessity of quitting it for ever.
 Twenty things, particularly, he says, he has suffered Joseph Leman to
 tell him of, that were not, and could not be true, in order to make
 himself formidable in some people's eyes, and this purely with a view
 to prevent mischief. He is unhappy, as far as he knows, in a quick
 invention; in hitting readily upon expedients; and many things are
 reported of him which he never said, and many which he never did, and
 others which he has only talked of, (as just now,) and which he has
 forgot as soon as the words have passed his lips.
 This may be so, in part, my dear. No one man so young could be so
 wicked as he has been reported to be. But such a man at the head of
 such wretches as he is said to have at his beck, all men of fortune and
 fearlessness, and capable of such enterprises as I have unhappily found
 him capable of, what is not to be apprehended from him!
 His carelessness about his character is one of his excuses: a very
 bad one. What hope can a woman have of a man who values not his own
 reputation?--These gay wretches may, in mixed conversation, divert for
 an hour, or so: but the man of probity, the man of virtue, is the man
 that is to be the partner for life. What woman, who could help it, would
 submit it to the courtesy of a wretch, who avows a disregard to all
 moral sanctions, whether he will perform his part of the matrimonial
 obligation, and treat her with tolerable politeness?
 With these notions, and with these reflections, to be thrown upon such a
 man myself!--Would to Heaven--But what avail wishes now?--To whom can I
 fly, if I would fly from him?
