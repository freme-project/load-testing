 concern and of that love; and have for years, which in persons so young
 may be called many, ranked in the first class of your friends,
 Your ever grateful and affectionate, ANNA HOWE?
 Will you oblige me with a copy of the preamble to the clauses in your
 grandfather's will in your favour; and allow me to send it to my aunt

 charmed her, that, though a stranger to you personally, she assents to
 the preference given you in that will, before she knows the testator's
 reasons for giving you that preference.

 How you oppress me, my dearest friend, with your politeness! I cannot
 doubt your sincerity; but you should take care, that you give me not
 reason from your kind partiality to call in question your judgment. You
 do not distinguish that I take many admirable hints from you, and have
 the art to pass them upon you for my own: for in all you do, in all you
 say, nay, in your very looks (so animated!) you give lessons to one
 who loves you and observes you as I love you and observe you, without
