it indeed in their countenances; and that they all expected something
 extraordinary to follow.--And so it should have done, had I been more
 sure than I am of their daughter's favour. Yet not a hair of any of
 their stupid heads do I intend to hurt.
 You shall all have your directions in writing, if there be occasion. But
 after all, I dare say there will be no need but to shew your faces in my
 company.
 Such faces never could four men shew--Mowbray's so fierce and so
 fighting: Belton's so pert and so pimply: Tourville's so fair and
 so foppish: thine so rough and so resolute: and I your leader!--What
 hearts, although meditating hostility, must those be which we shall not
 appall?--Each man occasionally attended by a servant or two, long ago
 chosen for qualities resembling those of his master.
 Thus, Jack, as thou desirest, have I written.--Written upon something;
 upon nothing; upon REVENGE, which I love; upon LOVE, which I hate,
 heartily hate, because 'tis my master: and upon the devil knows what
 besides: for looking back, I am amazed at the length of it. Thou mayest
 read it: I would not for a king's ransom. But so as I do but write, thou
 sayest thou wilt be pleased.
 Be pleased then. I command thee to be pleased: if not for the writer's
 or written sake, for thy word's sake. And so in the royal style (for am
 I not likely to be thy king and thy emperor in the great affair before
 us?) I bid thee very heartily
 Farewell.
