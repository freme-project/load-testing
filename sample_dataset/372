"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the
 stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He
 chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed
 a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
 As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one
 was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly
 finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was
 putting in the horse.
 "I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his
 boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the
 presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve
 to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the
 key of the affair now."
 "And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
 "In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he
 continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been
 there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this
 Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will
 not fit the lock."
 We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into
 the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and
 trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both
 sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country
 carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but
 the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
 some city in a dream.
 "It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,
 flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been
 as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than
 never to learn it at all."
