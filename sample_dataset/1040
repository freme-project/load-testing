agreeable. But, instead of complaints, he is 'full of tender concern
 lest I may have been prevented by indisposition, or by the closer
 confinement which he has frequently cautioned me that I may expect.'
 He says, 'He had been in different disguises loitering about our garden
 and park wall, all the day on Sunday last; and all Sunday night was
 wandering about the coppice, and near the back door. It rained; and he
 has got a great cold, attended with feverishness, and so hoarse, that he
 has almost lost his voice.'
 Why did he not flame out in his letter?--Treated as I am treated by my
 friends, it is dangerous to be laid under the sense of an obligation to
 an addresser's patience; especially when such a one suffers in health
 for my sake.
 'He had no shelter, he says, but under the great overgrown ivy, which
 spreads wildly round the heads of two or three oaklings; and that was
 soon wet through.'
 You remember the spot. You and I, my dear, once thought ourselves
 obliged to the natural shade which those ivy-covered oaklings afforded
 us, in a sultry day.
 I can't help saying, I am sorry he has suffered for my sake; but 'tis
 his own seeking.
 His letter is dated last night at eight: 'And, indisposed as he is,
 he tells me that he will watch till ten, in hopes of my giving him the
 meeting he so earnestly request. And after that, he has a mile to walk
 to his horse and servant; and four miles then to ride to his inn.'
 He owns, 'That he has an intelligencer in our family; who has failed
 him for a day or two past: and not knowing how I do, or how I may be
 treated, his anxiety is increased.'
 This circumstance gives me to guess who this intelligencer is: Joseph
 Leman: the very creature employed and confided in, more than any other,
 by my brother.
