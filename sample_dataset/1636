suspend my happy day.  And that nothing may be wanting to gratify your
 utmost punctilio, I will till then consent to stay here at Mrs.
 Sinclair's while you reside at your new house; and leave the rest to your
 own generosity.  O my beloved creature, will not this be agreeable to
 you?  I am sure it will--it must--and clasping her closer to me, I gave
 her a more fervent kiss than ever I had dared to give her before.  I
 permitted not my ardour to overcome my discretion, however; for I took
 care to set my foot upon the letter, and scraped it farther from her, as
 it were behind her chair.
 She was in a passion at the liberty I took.  Bowing low, I begged her
 pardon; and stooping still lower, in the same motion took up the letter,
 and whipt it into my bosom.
 Pox on me for a puppy, a fool, a blockhead, a clumsy varlet, a mere Jack
 Belford!--I thought myself a much cleverer fellow than I am!--Why could I
 not have been followed in by Dorcas, who might have taken it up, while I
 addressed her lady?
 For here, the letter being unfolded, I could not put it in my bosom
 without alarming her ears, as my sudden motion did her eyes--Up she flew
 in a moment: Traitor!  Judas! her eyes flashing lightning, and a
 perturbation in her eager countenance, so charming!--What have you taken
 up?--and then, what for both my ears I durst not have done to her, she
 made no scruple to seize the stolen letter, though in my bosom.
 What was to be done on so palpable a detection?--I clasped her hand,
 which had hold of the ravished paper, between mine: O my beloved
 creature! said I, can you think I have not some curiosity?  Is it
 possible you can be thus for ever employed; and I, loving narrative
 letter-writing above every other species of writing, and admiring your
 talent that way, should not (thus upon the dawn of my happiness, as I
 presume to hope) burn with a desire to be admitted into so sweet a
 correspondence?
