next apartment, on pretence of going to seek her sister, who all the time
 was locked up in the closet.'
 No woman ever gave me a private meeting for nothing; my dearest Miss
 Harlowe excepted.
 'My ingenuity obtained my pardon: the lady being unable to forbear
 laughing throughout the whole affair, to find both so uncommonly tricked;
 her gaoleress her prisoner, safe locked up, and as much pleased as either
 of us.'
 The English, Jack, do not often out-wit the French.
 'We had contrivances afterwards equally ingenious, in which the lady, the
 ice once broken [once subdued, always subdued] co-operated.  But a more
 tender tell-tale revealed the secret--revealed it, before the marquise
 could cover the disgrace.  The sister was inveterate; the husband
 irreconcilable; in every respect unfit for a husband, even for a French
 one--made, perhaps, more delicate to these particulars by the customs of
 a people among whom he was then resident, so contrary to those of his own
 countrymen.  She was obliged to throw herself into my protection--nor
 thought herself unhappy in it, till childbed pangs seized her: then
 penitence, and death, overtook her the same hour!'
 Excuse a tear, Belford!--She deserved a better fate!  What hath such a
 vile inexorable husband to answer for!--The sister was punished
 effectually--that pleases me on reflection--the sister effectually
 punished!--But perhaps I have told thee this story before.
