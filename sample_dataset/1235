Why, my dear, it is possible, that you may be more compliable than you
 have been.
 Why raised you my hopes, Madam?--Don't let me think my dear aunt Hervey
 cruel to a niece who truly honours her.
 I may tell you more perhaps, said she (but in confidence, absolute
 confidence) if the inquiry within came out in your favour. Do you know
 of any thin above that can be found to your disadvantage?--
 Some papers they will find, I doubt: but I must take consequences.
 My brother and sister will be at hand with their good-natured
 constructions. I am made desperate, and care not what is found.
 I hope, I earnestly hope, that nothing can be found that will impeach
 your discretion; and then--but I may say too much--
 And away she went, having added to my perplexity.
 But I now can think of nothing but this interview.--Would to Heaven it
 were over!--To meet to quarrel--but, let him take what measures he will,
 I will not stay a moment with him, if he be not quite calm and resigned.
 Don't you see how crooked some of my lines are? Don't you see how some
 of the letters stagger more than others?--That is when this interview is
 more in my head than in my subject.
 But, after all, should I, ought I to meet him? How have I taken it for
 granted that I should!--I wish there were time to take your advice. Yet
 you are so loth to speak quite out--but that I owe, as you own, to the
 difficulty of my situation.
 I should have mentioned, that in the course of this conversation I
 besought my aunt to stand my friend, and to put in a word for me on
 my approaching trial; and to endeavour to procure me time for
 consideration, if I could obtain nothing else.
 She told me, that, after the ceremony was performed [odious confirmation
 of a hint in my cousin Dolly's letter!] I should have what time I
 pleased to reconcile myself to my lot before cohabitation.
