 These vermin, added he, have a pride they can hardly rein-in, when
 they serve a man of family. They boast of their master's pedigree and
 descent, as if they were related to him. Nor is any thing they know of

 really thought of these for me. If I break off the talk here, and he
 resume this proposal with earnestness in the morning, I shall apprehend
 that he is less indifferent than he seems to be about my going to
