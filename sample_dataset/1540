think of leaving me for six hours together; and he had prepared the widow
 to expect, that we should be here but for a few days; only till we could
 fix ourselves in a house suitable to our condition; and this, that I
 might be under the less embarrassment, if I pleased to remove.
 Fix our-selves in a house, and we, and our, Mr. Lovelace--Pray, in what

 He interrupted me--Why, my dearest life, if you will hear me with
