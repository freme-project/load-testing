mine.--Unconditioned with, she was pleased to say, they shall be yours
 again, unseen by any body else.
 I thanked her; and she withdrew to read them; saying, she would return
 them, when she had.
 You, my dear, have seen all the letters that passed between Mr. Lovelace
 and me, till my last return from you. You have acknowledged, that he has
 nothing to boast of from them. Three others I have received since, by
 the private conveyance I told you of: the last I have not yet answered.
 In these three, as in those you have seen, after having besought my
 favour, and, in the most earnest manner, professed the ardour of his
 passion for me; and set forth the indignities done him; the defiances
 my brother throws out against him in all companies; the menaces, and
 hostile appearance of my uncles wherever they go; and the methods they
 take to defame him; he declares, 'That neither his own honour, nor
 the honour of his family, (involved as that is in the undistinguishing
 reflection cast upon him for an unhappy affair which he would have
 shunned, but could not) permit him to bear these confirmed indignities:
 that as my inclinations, if not favourable to him, cannot be, nor are,
 to such a man as the newly-introduced Solmes, he is interested the more
 to resent my brother's behaviour; who to every body avows his rancour
 and malice; and glories in the probability he has, through the address
 of this Solmes, of mortifying me, and avenging himself on him: that
 it is impossible he should not think himself concerned to frustrate a
 measure so directly levelled at him, had he not a still higher motive
 for hoping to frustrate it: that I must forgive him, if he enter into
 conference with Solmes upon it. He earnestly insists (upon what he has
 so often proposed) that I will give him leave, in company with Lord
 M. to wait upon my uncles, and even upon my father--and he promises
 patience, if new provocations, absolutely beneath a man to bear, be not
 given:' which by the way I am far from being able to engage for.
