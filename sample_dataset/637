 PREFACE
 The following History is given in a series of letters, written
 Principally in a double yet separate correspondence;
 Between two young ladies of virtue and honor, bearing an inviolable
 friendship for each other, and writing not merely for amusement, but
 upon the most interesting subjects; in which every private family, more
 or less, may find itself concerned; and,
 Between two gentlemen of free lives; one of them glorying in his
 talents for stratagem and invention, and communicating to the other, in
 confidence, all the secret purposes of an intriguing head and resolute
 heart.
 But here it will be proper to observe, for the sake of such as may
 apprehend hurt to the morals of youth, from the more freely-written
 letters, that the gentlemen, though professed libertines as to the
 female sex, and making it one of their wicked maxims, to keep no faith
 with any of the individuals of it, who are thrown into their power,
 are not, however, either infidels or scoffers; nor yet such as think
 themselves freed from the observance of those other moral duties which
 bind man to man.
