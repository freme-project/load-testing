enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.  I
 took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.
 Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
 have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by
 this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
 who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,
