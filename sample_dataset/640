work is--to warn the inconsiderate and thoughtless of the one sex,
 against the base arts and designs of specious contrivers of the
 other--to caution parents against the undue exercise of their natural
 authority over their children in the great article of marriage--to warn
 children against preferring a man of pleasure to a man of probity upon
 that dangerous but too-commonly-received notion, that a reformed rake
 makes the best husband--but above all, to investigate the highest and
 most important doctrines not only of morality, but of christianity, by
 showing them thrown into action in the conduct of the worthy characters;
 while the unworthy, who set those doctrines at defiance, are condignly,
 and, as may be said, consequentially punished.
 From what has been said, considerate readers will not enter upon the
 perusal of the piece before them as if it were designed only to divert
 and amuse. It will probably be thought tedious to all such as dip into
 it, expecting a light novel, or transitory romance; and look upon story
 in it (interesting as that is generally allowed to be) as its sole end,
 rather than as a vehicle to the instruction.
 Different persons, as might be expected, have been of different
 opinions, in relation to the conduct of the Heroine in particular
 situations; and several worthy persons have objected to the general
 catastrophe, and other parts of the history. Whatever is thought
 material of these shall be taken notice of by way of Postscript, at the
 conclusion of the History; for this work being addressed to the public
 as a history of life and manners, those parts of it which are
 proposed to carry with them the force of an example, ought to be as
 unobjectionable as is consistent with the design of the whole, and with
 human nature.
