hate; and who could have no pretension to dispute that right with them,
 unless what he had from her who had none over herself? And how must
 this insolence of his, aggravated as my brother is able to aggravate it,
 exasperate them against me?
 The rash man has indeed so far gained his point, as to intimidate them
 from attempting to carry me away: but he has put them upon a surer and
 a more desperate measure: and this has driven me also into one as
 desperate; the consequence of which, although he could not foresee it,*
 may perhaps too well answer his great end, little as he deserves to have
 it answered.
      * She was mistaken in this. Mr. Lovelace did foresee this
      consequence. All his contrivances led to it, and the whole
      family, as he boasts, unknown to themselves, were but so
      many puppets danced by his wires. See Vol.I. Letter XXXI.
 In short, I have done, as far as I know, the most rash thing that ever I
 did in my life.
 But let me give you the motive, and then the action will follow of
 course.
 About six o'clock this evening, my aunt (who stays here all night, on my
 account, no doubt) came up and tapped at my door; for I was writing;
 and had locked myself in. I opened it; and she entering, thus delivered
 herself:
 I come once more to visit you, my dear; but sorely against my will;
 because it is to impart to you matters of the utmost concern to you, and
 to the whole family.
 What, Madam, is now to be done with me? said I, wholly attentive.
 You will not be hurried away to your uncle's, child; let that comfort
 you.--They see your aversion to go.--You will not be obliged to go to
 your uncle Antony's.
 How you revive me, Madam! this is a cordial to my heart!
