 These are the difficulties which arise to me on revolving this scheme;
 which, nevertheless, might appear surmountable to a more enterprising
 spirit in my circumstances. If you, my dear, think them surmountable in
 any one of the cases put, [and to be sure I can take no course, but what
 must have some difficulty in it,] be pleased to let me know your free
