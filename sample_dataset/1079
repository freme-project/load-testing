may be pained: you would lose you end if I were not: but after the first
 sensibility (as I have said more than once before) I will love you the
 better, and my amended heart shall be all yours; and it will then be
 more worthy to be yours.
 You have taught me what to say to, and what to think of, Mr. Lovelace.
 You have, by agreeable anticipation, let me know how it is probable he
 will apply to me to be excused. I will lay every thing before you that
 shall pass on the occasion, if he do apply, that I may take your advice,

 do nothing but by her orders, and by her advice and yours: not see
 any body: not write to any body: nor shall any living soul, but by her
 direction and yours, know where I am. In any cottage place me, I will
 never stir out, unless, disguised as your servant, I am now-and-then
 permitted an evening-walk with you: and this private protection to be
