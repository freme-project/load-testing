 It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late
 he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
 farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been
 confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and
 shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him
