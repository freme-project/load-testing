 As to the former part of your speech, Betty, said I, you observe well;
 and I have often thought, when I have seen how healthy the children of
 the labouring poor look, and are, with empty stomachs, and hardly a good
 meal in a week, that God Almighty is very kind to his creatures, in this
 respect, as well as in all others in making much not necessary to the
