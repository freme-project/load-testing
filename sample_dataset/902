is it more. I never was in love as it is called; and whether this be it,
 or not, I must submit to you. But will venture to think it, if it be,
 no such mighty monarch, no such unconquerable power, as I have heard
 it represented; and it must have met with greater encouragement than
 I think I have given it, to be absolutely unconquerable--since I am
 persuaded, that I could yet, without a throb, most willingly give up the
 one man to get rid of the other.
 But now to be a little more serious with you: if, my dear, my
 particularly-unhappy situation had driven (or led me, if you please)
 into a liking of the man; and if that liking had, in your opinion,
 inclined me to love him, should you, whose mind is susceptible of the
 most friendly impressions, who have such high notions of the delicacy
 which ought to be observed by our sex in these matters, and who actually
 do enter so deeply into the distresses of one you love--should you
 have pushed so far that unhappy friend on so very nice a
 subject?--Especially, when I aimed not (as you could prove by fifty
 instances, it seems) to guard against being found out. Had you rallied
 me by word of mouth in the manner you do, it might have been more in
 character; especially, if your friend's distresses had been surmounted,
 and if she had affected prudish airs in revolving the subject: but to
 sit down to write it, as methinks I see you, with a gladdened eye, and
 with all the archness of exultation--indeed, my dear, (and I take notice
 of it, rather for the sake of your own generosity, than for my sake,
 for, as I have said, I love your raillery,) it is not so very pretty;
 the delicacy of the subject, and the delicacy of your own mind,
 considered.
 I lay down my pen here, that you may consider of it a little, if you
 please.
 I resume, to give you my opinion of the force which figure or person
 ought to have upon our sex: and this I shall do both generally as to the
