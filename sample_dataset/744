I have made inquiry already after a housekeeper. I would have had your
 good Norton; but I suppose you will yourself wish to have the worthy
 woman with you. If you desire it, that shall be agreed upon for you.
 But, why, dearest Madam, why am I, the youngest, to be precipitated into
 a state, that I am very far from wishing to enter into with any body?
 You are going to question me, I suppose, why your sister is not thought

 I hope, Madam, it will not displease you if I were.
 I might refer you for an answer to your father.--Mr. Solmes has reasons

 And I have reasons, Madam, for disliking him. And why I am--
 This quickness upon me, interrupted my mother, is not to be borne! I am
 gone, and your father comes, if I can do no good with you.

 uncles, to judge what will do it honour, what dishonour.
 I then offered to live single; never to marry at all; or never but with
 their full approbation.
 If you mean to shew your duty, and your obedience, Clary, you must shew
 it in our way, not in your own.
 I hope, Madam, that I have not so behaved hitherto, as to render such a
 trial of my obedience necessary.
 Yes, Clary, I cannot but say that you have hitherto behaved extremely
