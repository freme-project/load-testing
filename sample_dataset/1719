pursuit.
 From such a woman as Miss Harlowe, a man is secured from all the
 inconveniencies thou expatiatest upon.
 Once more, therefore, do I thank thee, Belford, for thy approbation!--A

 wert pleading for matrimony in behalf of this lady!--It could not be
 principle, I knew, in thee: it could not be compassion--a little envy
 indeed I suspected!--But now I see thee once more thyself: and once more,
 say I, a blessing on thy heart, thou true friend, and very honest fellow!
 Now will I proceed with courage in all my schemes, and oblige thee with
 the continued narrative of my progressions towards bringing them to
 effect!--but I could not forbear to interrupt my story, to show my
 gratitude.
 LETTER XL
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
 And now will I favour thee with a brief account of our present situation.
 From the highest to the lowest we are all extremely happy.--Dorcas stands

 it.  She blamed Sally for behaving tyrannically to a man who loves her.
 Dear creature! to stand against a glass, and to shut her eyes because she
