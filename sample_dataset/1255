committed at your feet, fly, fly, I beseech you.
 O Lord:--help, help, cried the fool, all in amaze and confusion,
 frighted beyond the power of controuling.
 Now behind me, now before me, now on this side, now on that, turned I my
 affrighted face, in the same moment; expecting a furious brother here,
 armed servants there, an enraged sister screaming, and a father armed
 with terror in his countenance more dreadful than even the drawn sword
 which I saw, or those I apprehended. I ran as fast as he; yet knew not
 that I ran; my fears adding wings to my feet, at the same time that they
 took all power of thinking from me--my fears, which probably would not
 have suffered me to know what course to take, had I not had him to urge
 and draw me after him: especially as I beheld a man, who must have come
 out of the door, keeping us in his eye, running now towards us; then
 back to the garden; beckoning and calling to others, whom I supposed he
 saw, although the turning of the wall hindered me from seeing them; and
 whom I imagined to be my brother, my father, and their servants.
 Thus terrified, I was got out of sight of the door in a very few
 minutes: and then, although quite breathless between running and
 apprehension, he put my arm under his, his drawn sword in the other
 hand, and hurried me on still faster: my voice, however, contradicting
 my action; crying, no, no, no, all the while; straining my neck to look
 back, as long as the walls of the garden and park were within sight,
 and till he brought me to the chariot: where, attending, were two armed
 servants of his own, and two of Lord M.'s on horseback.
 Here I must suspend my relation for a while: for now I am come to this
 sad period of it, my indiscretion stares me in the face; and my shame
 and my grief give me a compunction that is more poignant methinks than
 if I had a dagger in my heart. To have it to reflect, that I should
 so inconsiderately give in to an interview, which, had I known either
 myself or him, or in the least considered the circumstances of the case,
