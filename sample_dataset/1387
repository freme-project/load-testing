 He has been very solicitous to keep to the letter of my instructions:
 which looked well: and the better I like him, as, although he proposed
 that town, he came back, dissuading me from it: for he said, that, in
 his journey from thence, he had thought Windsor, although of his own
 proposal, a wrong choice; because I coveted privacy, and that was a
