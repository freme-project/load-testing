 leads, let me patiently and unrepiningly follow!--I shall not live
 always!--May but my closing scene be happy!
 But I will not oppress you, my dearest friend, with further reflections
 of this sort. I will take them all into myself. Surely I have a mind
 that has room for them. My afflictions are too sharp to last long. The
 crisis is at hand. Happier times you bid me hope for. I will hope.

 But yet, I cannot be but impatient at times, to find myself thus driven,
 and my character so depreciated and sunk, that were all the future to be

 all by the instigation of a selfish brother, and envious sister--
 But let me stop: let me reflect!--Are not these suggestions the
 suggestions of the secret pride I have been censuring? Then, already
 so impatient! but this moment so resigned, so much better disposed
 for reflection! yet 'tis hard, 'tis very hard, to subdue an embittered
 spirit!--in the instant of its trial too!--O my cruel brother!--but
 now it rises again.--I will lay down a pen I am so little able
 to govern.--And I will try to subdue an impatience, which (if my
 afflictions are sent me for corrective ends) may otherwise lead me into
 still more punishable errors.--

 As to the first; to wit, your advice for me to escape to London--let me
 tell you, that the other hint or proposal which accompanies it perfectly
 frightens me--surely, my dear, (happy as you are, and indulgently
 treated as your mother treats you,) you cannot mean what you propose!
 What a wretch must I be, if, for one moment only, I could lend an ear
