justify: that things drawing towards a crisis between my friends and me,
 an interview could avail nothing; especially as the method by which this
 correspondence was carried on was not suspected, and he could write all
 that was in his mind to write: that I expected to be at liberty to judge
 of what was proper and fit upon this occasion: especially as he might be
 assured, that I would sooner choose death, than Mr. Solmes.'
 TUESDAY NIGHT.
 I have deposited my letter to Mr. Lovelace. Threatening as things look
 against me, I am much better pleased with myself for declining the
 interview than I was before. I suppose he will be a little out of humour
 upon it, however: but as I reserved to myself the liberty of changing my
 mind; and as it is easy for him to imagine there may be reasons for it
 within-doors, which he cannot judge of without; besides those I have
 suggested, which of themselves are of sufficient weight to engage his
 acquiescence; I should think it strange, if he acquiesces not on this
 occasion, and that with a cheerfulness, which may shew me, that his last
 letter is written from his heart: For, if he be really so much concerned
 at his past faults, as he pretends, and has for some time pretended,
 must he not, of course, have corrected, in some degree, the impetuosity
 of his temper? The first step to reformation, as I conceive, is to
 subdue sudden gusts of passion, from which frequently the greatest evils
 arise, and to learn to bear disappointments. If the irascible passions
 cannot be overcome, what opinion can we have of the person's power over
 those to which bad habit, joined to greater temptation, gives stronger
 force?
 Pray, my dear, be so kind as to make inquiry, by some safe hand, after
 the disguises Mr. Lovelace assumes at the inn he puts up at in the poor
 village of Neale, he calls it. If it be the same I take it to be, I
 never knew it was considerable enough to have a name; nor that it has an
 inn in it.
