Upon the whole, there seems, as I have often said, to have been a kind of
 fate in your error, if it were an error; and this perhaps admitted for
 the sake of a better example to be collected from your SUFFERINGS, than
 could have been given, had you never erred: for my dear, the time of
 ADVERSITY is your SHINING-TIME.  I see it evidently, that adversity must
 call forth graces and beauties which could not have been brought to light
 in a run of that prosperous fortune which attended you from your cradle
 till now; admirably as you became, and, as we all thought, greatly as you
 deserved that prosperity.
 All the matter is, the trial must be grievous to you.  It is to me: it is
 to all who love you, and looked upon you as one set aloft to be admired
 and imitated, and not as a mark, as you have lately found, for envy to
 shoot its shafts at.
 Let what I have written above have its due weight with you, my dear; and
 then, as warm imaginations are not without a mixture of enthusiasm, your
 Anna Howe, who, on reperusal of it, imagines it to be in a style superior
 to her usual style, will be ready to flatter herself that she has been in
 a manner inspired with the hints that have comforted and raised the
 dejected heart of her suffering friend; who, from such hard trials, in a
 bloom so tender, may find at times her spirits sunk too low to enable her
 to pervade the surrounding darkness, which conceals from her the hopeful
 dawning of the better day which awaits her.
 I will add no more at present, than that I am
 Your ever faithful and affectionate
 ANNA HOWE.
