dislike to her.--Should she bring her to me?
 I was very busy, I said: the letter I was writing was upon a very
 important subject.  I hoped to see the young lady in the morning, when I
 would apologize to her for my particularity.  And then Mrs. Sinclair
 hesitating, and moving towards the door, (though she turned round to me
 again,) I desired her, (lighting her,) to take care how she went down.
 Pray, Madam, said she, on the stairs-head, don't give yourself all this
 trouble. God knows my heart, I meant no affront: but, since you seem to
 take my freedom amiss, I beg you will not acquaint Mr. Lovelace with it;
 for he perhaps will think me bold and impertinent.
 Now, my dear, is not this a particular incident, either as I have made
 it, or as it was designed?  I don't love to do an uncivil thing.  And if
 nothing were meant by the request, my refusal deserves to be called
 uncivil.  Then I have shown a suspicion of foul usage by it, which surely
 dare not be meant.  If just, I ought to apprehend every thing, and fly
 the house and the man as I would an infection.  If not just, and if I
 cannot contrive to clear myself of having entertained suspicions, by
 assigning some other plausible reason for my denial, the very staying
 here will have an appearance not at all reputable to myself.
 I am now out of humour with him,--with myself,--with all the world, but
 you.  His companions are shocking creatures.  Why, again I repeat, should
 he have been desirous to bring me into such company?  Once more I like
 him not.--Indeed I do not like him!
 LETTER IX
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 TUESDAY, MAY 2.
 With infinite regret I am obliged to tell you, that I can no longer write
 to you, or receive letters from you.--Your mother has sent me a letter
 enclosed in a cover to Mr. Lovelace, directed for him at Lord M.'s, (and
 which was brought him just now,) reproaching me on this subject in very
