meritorious, yet so much oppressed?
 Adieu, my dear. I will be ever yours. ANNA HOWE.

 [Clarissa, in her answer to the first of the two last letters, chides
 her   friend for giving so little weight to her advice, in relation to her
    behaviour to her mother.  It may be proper to insert here the
    following extracts from that answer, though a little before the time.]
 You assume, my dear, says she, your usual and ever-agreeable style in
 what you write of the two gentlemen,* and how unaptly you think they
 have chosen; Mr. Hickman in addressing you, Mr. Lovelace me. But I am
 inclinable to believe that, with a view to happiness, however two mild
 tempers might agree, two high ones would make sad work of it, both at
 one time violent and unyielding. You two might, indeed, have raqueted
 the ball betwixt you, as you say.** But Mr. Hickman, by his gentle
 manners, seems formed for you, if you go not too far with him. If you
 do, it would be a tameness in him to bear it, which would make a man
 more contemptible than Mr. Hickman can ever deserve to be made. Nor is
 it a disgrace for even a brave man, who knows what a woman is to vow to
 him afterwards, to be very obsequious beforehand.
      * See Letter XXXV. and Letter XXXVI. of this volume.
 ** See Letter XXXVI. of this volume.
 Do you think it is to the credit of Mr. Lovelace's character that he
 can be offensive and violent?--Does he not, as all such spirits must,
 subject himself to the necessity of making submissions for his excesses
 far more mortifying to a proud heart than those condescensions which the
 high-spirited are so apt to impute as a weakness of mind in such a man
 as Mr. Hickman?
 Let me tell you, my dear, that Mr. Hickman is such a one as would rather
 bear an affront from a lady, than offer one to her. He had rather, I
 dare say, that she should have occasion to ask his pardon than he her's.
