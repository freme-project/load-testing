lost nothing by them."
 "No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
 and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a
 prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it
 cost them two and thirty pounds."
 "We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,
 one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who
 first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he
 been with you?"
 "About a month then."
 "How did he come?"
 "In answer to an advertisement."
 "Was he the only applicant?"
 "No, I had a dozen."
 "Why did you pick him?"
 "Because he was handy and would come cheap."
 "At half-wages, in fact."
 "Yes."
 "What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
 "Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
 though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon
 his forehead."
 Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought
 as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are
 pierced for earrings?"
 "Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he
 was a lad."
 "Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still
 with you?"
 "Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
