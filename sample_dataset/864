 garden: for this attempt has confirmed them in their belief, that now
 they have turned off her maid, she has no way to send a letter out of
 the house: if she had, she would not have run the risque of tempting
 a fellow who had not been in her secret--so that she can prosecute
 unsuspectedly her correspondence with me and Miss Howe.
 In the next place, it will perhaps afford me an opportunity of a private

 But I was obliged previously to give him my honour, that no mischief

 fellow tells me, that he loves all his masters: and, only that he knows
