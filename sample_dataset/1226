now those apprehensions engage my whole attention, and make me sick at
 the very heart.
 SUNDAY, FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON.
 My letter is not yet taken away--If he should not send for it, or take
 it, or come hither on my not meeting him to-morrow, in doubt of what
 may have befallen me, what shall I do! Why had I any concerns with this
