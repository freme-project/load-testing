violence enter into the heart of a wretch, who might entitle himself to
 all her willing yet virtuous love, and make the blessings he aspireth
 after, her duty to confer?--Begone, villain-purposes!  Sink ye all to the
 hell that could only inspire ye!  And I am then ready to throw myself at
 her feet, to confess my villainous designs, to avow my repentance, and
 put it out of my power to act unworthily by such an excellence.
 How then comes it, that all these compassionate, and, as some would call
 them, honest sensibilities go off!--Why, Miss Howe will tell thee: she
 says, I am the devil.--By my conscience, I think he has at present a
 great share in me.
 There's ingenuousness!--How I lay myself open to thee!--But seest thou not,
 that the more I say against myself, the less room there is for thee
 to take me to task?--O Belford, Belford!  I cannot, cannot (at least at
 present) I cannot marry.
 Then her family, my bitter enemies--to supple to them, or if I do not, to
 make her as unhappy as she can be from my attempts----
 Then does she not love them too much, me too little?
 She now seems to despise me:  Miss Howe declares, that she really does
 despise me.  To be despised by a WIFE--What a thought is that!--To be
 excelled by a WIFE too, in every part of praise-worthy knowledge!--To
 take lessons, to take instructions, from a WIFE!--More than despise me,
 she herself has taken time to consider whether she does not hate me:--
 I hate you, Lovelace, with my whole heart, said she to me but yesterday!
 My soul is above thee, man!--Urge me not to tell thee how sincerely I
 think my soul above thee!--How poor indeed was I then, even in my own
 heart!--So visible a superiority, to so proud a spirit as mine!--And here
 from below, from BELOW indeed! from these women!  I am so goaded on----
 Yet 'tis poor too, to think myself a machine in the hands of such
 wretches.--I am no machine.--Lovelace, thou art base to thyself, but to
 suppose thyself a machine.
