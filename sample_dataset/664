university; and it gained him many friends among the more learned; while
 those who did not love him, feared him, by reason of the offence his
 vivacity made him too ready to give, and of the courage he shewed in
 supporting the offence when given; which procured him as many followers
 as he pleased among the mischievous sort.--No very amiable character,
 you'll say, upon the whole.
 But my brother's temper was not more happy. His native haughtiness could
 not bear a superiority so visible; and whom we fear more than love, we
 are not far from hating: and having less command of his passions than
 the other, he was evermore the subject of his perhaps indecent
 ridicule: so that every body, either from love or fear, siding with his
 antagonist, he had a most uneasy time of it while both continued in the
 same college.--It was the less wonder therefore that a young man who is
 not noted for the gentleness of his temper, should resume an antipathy
 early begun, and so deeply rooted.
 He found my sister, who waited but for the occasion, ready to join him
 in his resentments against the man he hated. She utterly disclaimed
 all manner of regard for him: 'Never liked him at all:--His estate was
 certainly much incumbered: it was impossible it should be otherwise; so
 entirely devoted as he was to his pleasures. He kept no house; had no
 equipage: Nobody pretended that he wanted pride: the reason therefore
 was easy to be guessed at.' And then did she boast of, and my brother
 praised her for, refusing him: and both joined on all occasions to
 depreciate him, and not seldom made the occasions; their displeasure
 against him causing every subject to run into this, if it began not with
 I was not solicitous to vindicate him when I was not joined in their
 reflection. I told them I did not value him enough to make a difference
 in the family on his account: and as he was supposed to have given
 much cause for their ill opinion of him, I thought he ought to take the
 consequence of his own faults.
