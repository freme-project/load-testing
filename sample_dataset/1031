and favour, which I used for eighteen years together to rejoice in, and
 be distinguished by!--And what a charming pretence will this afford me
 of breaking with Mr. Lovelace! And how easily will it possibly make him
 to part with me!
 I found this morning, in the usual place, a letter from him, in answer,
 I suppose, to mine of Friday, which I deposited not till Saturday. But
 I have not opened it; nor will I, till I see what effect this new offer
 will have.
 Let me but be permitted to avoid the man I hate; and I will give up with
 cheerfulness the man I could prefer. To renounce the one, were I really
 to value him as much as you seem to imagine, can give but a temporary
 concern, which time and discretion will alleviate. This is a sacrifice
 which a child owes to parents and friends, if they insist upon its being
 made. But the other, to marry a man one cannot endure, is not only a
 dishonest thing, as to the man; but it is enough to make a creature who
 wishes to be a good wife, a bad or indifferent one, as I once wrote to
 the man himself: and then she can hardly be either a good mistress, or
 a good friend; or any thing but a discredit to her family, and a bad
 example to all around her.
 Methinks I am loth, in the suspense I am in at present, to deposit
 this, because it will be leaving you in one as great: but having been
 prevented by Betty's officiousness twice, I will now go down to my
 little poultry; and, if I have an opportunity, will leave it in the
 usual place, where I hope to find something from you.
 LETTER XVII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY AFTERNOON, MARCH 27.
 I have deposited my narrative down to this day noon; but I hope soon to
 follow it with another letter, that I may keep you as little a while as
 possible in that suspense which I am so much affected by at this moment:
 for my heart is disturbed at ever foot I hear stir; and at every door
