babyhood have dressed her as such, nor would she, but upon that
 conviction, have continued the dress.
 'Let me ask you, Madam, I beseech you tell me, what I have done to
 deserve this distant treatment?
 'And let me ask you, Mr. Lovelace, why are my retirements to be thus
 invaded?--What can you have to say to me since last night, that I went
 with you so much against my will to the play? and after sitting up with
 you, equally against my will, till a very late hour?
 'This I have to say, Madam, that I cannot bear to be kept at this
 distance from you under the same roof.
 'Under the same roof, Sir!--How came you----
 'Hear me out, Madam--[letting go her trembling hands, and snatching them
 back again with an eagerness that made her start]--I have a thousand
 things to say, to talk of, relating to our present and future prospects;
 but when I want to open my whole soul to you, you are always contriving
 to keep me at a distance.  You make me inconsistent with myself.  Your
 heart is set upon delays.  You must have views that you will not own.
 Tell me, Madam, I conjure you to tell me, this moment, without subterfuge
 or reserve, in what light am I to appear to you in future?  I cannot bear
 this distance.  The suspense you hold me in I cannot bear.
 'In what light, Mr. Lovelace! [visibly terrified.]  In no bad light, I
 hope.--Pray, Mr. Lovelace, do not grasp my hands so hard [endeavouring to
 withdraw them.]  Pray let me go.--
 'You hate me, Madam--
 'I hate nobody, Sir--
 'You hate me, Madam, repeated I.
 'Instigated and resolved, as I came up, I wanted some new provocation.
 The devil indeed, as soon as my angel made her appearance, crept out of
 my heart; but he had left the door open, and was no farther off than my
 elbow.
