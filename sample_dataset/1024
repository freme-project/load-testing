to me, will it be, whether Mr. Lovelace be a good man, or a bad? And if
 not to them, nor to me, I see not how it can be of any to you. But if
 you do, I have nothing to say to that; and it will be a christian part
 if you will expostulate with him upon the errors you have discovered,
 and endeavour to make him as good a man, as, no doubt, you are yourself,
 or you would not be so ready to detect and expose him.
 Excuse me, Sir: but, after my former letter to you, and your ungenerous
 perseverance; and after this attempt to avail yourself at the expense of
 another man's character, rather than by your own proper merit; I see
 not that you can blame any asperity in her, whom you have so largely
 contributed to make unhappy.

 SUNDAY NIGHT.
 My father was for coming up to me, in great wrath, it seems; but was
 persuaded to the contrary. My aunt Hervey was permitted to send me this
 that follow.--Quick work, my dear!
 TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE
 NIECE,
 Every body is now convinced, that nothing is to be done with you by way
 of gentleness or persuasion. Your mother will not permit you to stay in
 the house; for your father is so incensed by your strange letter to his
 friend, that she knows not what will be the consequence if you do. So,
 you are commanded to get ready to go to your uncle Antony's out of hand.
 Your uncle thinks he has not deserved of you such an unwillingness as
 you shew to go to his house.
 You don't know the wickedness of the man for whose sake you think it
 worth while to quarrel with all your friends.
 You must not answer me. There will be no end of that.
 You know not the affliction you give to every body; but to none more
