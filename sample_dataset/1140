I answered him only with a look; but it was of high disdain; and turning
 from him,--But what favour, dear Madam, [to my aunt,] has the instance
 of duty you mention procured me?
 Your mother and Mr. Solmes, replied my aunt, have prevailed, that your
 request to stay here till Monday next shall be granted, if you will
 promise to go cheerfully then.
 Let me but choose my own visiters, and I will go to my uncle's house
 with pleasure.
 Well, Niece, said my aunt, we must wave this subject, I find. We will

 and to say to you on this head.
 If, Madam, Mr. Solmes will be pleased to declare, that he has no view
 to serve, no end to promote, for himself, I will hear any thing he shall
 read. But if the contrary, you must allow me to say, that it will abate
 with me a great deal of the weight of whatever he shall produce.
 Hear it but read, Niece, said my aunt--
