'but that he apprehends my consent to make him happy is at a greater
 distance than he wishes; and complained of too severe restrictions I

 What, my dear, shall I say to this? How shall I take it? Mrs. Greme is
 a good woman. Mrs. Sorlings is a good woman. And this letter agrees with
 the conversation between Mr. Lovelace and me, which I thought, and
 still think, so agreeable.* Yet what means the man by foregoing the
 opportunities he has had to declare himself?--What mean his complaints
 of my restrictions to Mrs. Greme? He is not a bashful man.--But you say,
 I inspire people with an awe of me.--An awe, my dear!--As how?

 be an example to young persons of my sex! Let me be but a warning, and I

 companions.

 only to her own enemies, and to the enemies of her family.
 What an useful lesson would this afford, were it properly inculcated at
 the time that the tempted mind was balancing upon a doubtful adventure?
 You know not, my dear, the worth of a virtuous man; and, noble-minded as
 you are in most particulars, you partake of the common weakness of human
 nature, in being apt to slight what is in your own power.
