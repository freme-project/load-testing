I am extremely apprehensive that this worse than ghost-like appearance
 of his, bodes some still bolder step. If he come hither (and very
 desirous he is of my leave to come) I am afraid there will be murder. To
 avoid that, if there were no other way, I would most willingly be buried
 alive.
 They are all in consultation--upon my letters, I suppose--so they were
 in the morning; which occasioned my uncles to be at our church. I will
 send you the copies of those letters, as I promised in my last, when
 I see whether I can give you their answers with them. This letter is
 all--I cannot tell what--the effect of apprehension and displeasure
 at the man who has occasioned my apprehensions. Six lines would have
 contained all that is in it to the purpose of my story.

 LETTER XXXI
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. MONDAY, MARCH 13.
 In vain dost thou* and thy compeers press me to go to town, while I am
 in such an uncertainty as I am in at present with this proud beauty.
 All the ground I have hitherto gained with her is entirely owing to her
 concern for the safety of people whom I have reason to hate.
      *These gentlemen affected what they called the Roman style
      (to wit, the thee and the thou) in their letters: and it was
      an agreed rule with them, to take in good part whatever
      freedoms they treated each other with, if the passages were
      written in that style.
 Write then, thou biddest me, if I will not come. That, indeed, I can do;
 and as well without a subject, as with one. And what follows shall be a
 proof of it.
 The lady's malevolent brother has now, as I told thee at M. Hall,
 introduced another man; the most unpromising in his person and
 qualities, the most formidable in his offers, that has yet appeared.
