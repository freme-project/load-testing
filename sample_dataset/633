and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll
 serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
 could go.
 
 "He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
 
 "I have my revolver," said I.
 
 "Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed
 down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we
 heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a
 horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An
 elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
 at a side door.
 
 "My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been
 fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
 
 Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with
 Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its
 black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and
 screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and
 it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
 creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and
 carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid
 him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered
 Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
 relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door
 opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
