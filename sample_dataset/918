oblige, I was happy in it: I looked for no further reward: my mind is
 above art, from the dirty motives you mention. I wish with all my heart
 my grandfather had not thus distinguished me; he saw my brother likely
 to be amply provided for out of the family, as well as in it: he desired
 that you might have the greater share of my father's favour for it;
 and no doubt but you both have. You know, Bella, that the estate my
 grandfather bequeathed me was not half the real estate he left.
 What's all that to an estate in possession, and left you with such
 distinctions, as gave you a reputation of greater value than the estate
 itself?
 Hence my misfortune, Bella, in your envy, I doubt!--But have I not given
 up that possession in the best manner I could--
 Yes, interrupting me, she hated me for that best manner. Specious little
 witch! she called me: your best manner, so full of art and design, had
 never been seen through, if you, with your blandishing ways, have not
 been put out of sight, and reduced to positive declarations!--Hindered
 from playing your little declarations!--Hindered from playing your
 little whining tricks! curling, like a serpent about your mamma; and
 making her cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set
 upon--!
 Obstinate heart, Bella!
 Yes, obstinate heart! For did you ever give up any thing? Had you not
 the art to make them think all was right you asked, though my brother
 and I were frequently refused favours of no greater import!
 I know not, Bella, that I ever asked any thing unfit to be granted. I
 seldom asked favours for myself, but for others.
 I was a reflecting creature for this.
 All you speak of, Bella, was a long time ago. I cannot go so far back
 into our childish follies. Little did I think of how long standing your
 late-shewn antipathy is.
