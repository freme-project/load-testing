the girl behaved very modestly--over-did it a little perhaps. Her
 ladyship shrunk back, and looked shy upon her. The doctrine of
 sympathies and antipathies is a surprising doctrine. But Dorcas will be
 excessively obliging, and win her lady's favour soon, I doubt not. I
 am secure in one of the wench's qualities however--she is not to be

 knows nothing of the town, and has seen less of its diversions than
 ever woman of her taste, her fortune, her endowments, did see. She has,
 indeed, a natural politeness, which transcends all acquirement. The most
 capable of any one I ever knew of judging what an hundred things are, by
