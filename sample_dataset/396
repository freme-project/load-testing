"I don't believe it."
 "D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled
 them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that
 went to the Alpha were town bred."
 "You'll never persuade me to believe that."
 "Will you bet, then?"
 "It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
 I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be
 obstinate."
 The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said
 he.
 The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
 greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
 lamp.
 "Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I
 was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is
 still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
 "Well?"
 "That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,
 then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers
 after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
 Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a
 list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just
 read it out to me."
 "Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.
 "Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."
 Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs.
 Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'"
 "Now, then, what's the last entry?"
 "'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"
