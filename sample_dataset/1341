character; and one indeed whose first view it was to draw her into this
 correspondence; and who succeeded in it by means unknown to herself.
 'Now, what were her inducements to this correspondence?' If not what her
 niceness makes her think blameworthy, why does she blame herself?
 Has she been capable of error? Of persisting in that error?
 Whoever was the tempter, that is not the thing; nor what the temptation.
 The fact, the error, is now before us.
 Did she persist in it against parental prohibition?
 She owns she did.
 Was a daughter ever known who had higher notions of the filial duty, of
 the parental authority?
 Never.
 'What must be the inducements, how strong, that were too strong for
 duty, in a daughter so dutiful?--What must my thoughts have been of
 these inducements, what my hopes built upon them at the time, taken in
 this light?'
 Well, but it will be said, That her principal view was to prevent
 mischief between her brother and her other friends, and the man vilely
 insulted by them all.
 But why should she be more concerned for the safety of others than they
 were for their own? And had not the rencounter then happened? 'Was a
 person of virtue to be prevailed upon to break through her apparent, her
 acknowledged duty, upon any consideration?' And, if not, was she to be
 so prevailed upon to prevent an apprehended evil only?
 Thou, Lovelace, the tempter (thou wilt again break out and say) to be
 the accuser!
 But I am not the accuser. I am the arguer only, and, in my heart,
 all the time acquit and worship the divine creature. 'But let me,
 nevertheless, examine, whether the acquital be owing to her merit, or to
 my weakness--Weakness the true name of love!'
