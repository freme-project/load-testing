cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then
 I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I
 had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
 London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which
 took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once
 more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
 to some other building.
 "So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
 surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
 ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
 It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
 assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had
 never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his
 face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
 remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of
 those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they
 were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and
 Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I
 had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I
 called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
 directors, with the result that you have seen."
 "And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
 to-night?" I asked.
 "Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that
 they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other
 words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential
 that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the
 bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
 any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
 For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
