meanest, at least youngest, of my father's family, to thrust myself
 in the gap between such uncontroulable spirits!--To the intercepting
 perhaps of the designs of Providence, which may intend to make those
 hostile spirits their own punishers.--If so, what presumption!--Indeed,
 my dear friend, I am afraid I have thought myself of too much
 consequence. But, however this be, it is good, when calamities befal us,
 that we should look into ourselves, and fear.
 If I am prevented depositing this and the enclosed, (as I intend to try
 to do, late as it is,) I will add to it as occasion shall offer. Mean
 time, believe me to be
 Your ever-affectionate and grateful CL. HARLOWE.

 LETTER XXXVII
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.
 I have your three letters. Never was there a creature more impatient on
 the most interesting uncertainty than I was, to know the event of the
 interview between you and Solmes.
 It behoves me to account to my dear friend, in her present unhappy
 situation, for every thing that may have the least appearance of
 negligence or remissness on my part. I sent Robin in the morning early,
 in hopes of a deposit. He loitered about the place till near ten to
 no purpose; and then came away; my mother having given him a letter to
 carry to Mr. Hunt's, which he was to deliver before three, when only, in
 the day-time, that gentleman is at home; and to bring back an answer to
 it. Mr. Hunt's house, you know, lies wide from Harlowe-place. Robin but
 just saved his time; and returned not till it was too late to send him
 again. I only could direct him to set out before day this morning; and
 if he got any letter, to ride as for his life to bring it to me.
