My brother's acquisition then took place. This made us all very happy;
 and he went down to take possession of it: and his absence (on so good
 an account too) made us still happier. Then followed Lord M.'s proposal
 for my sister: and this was an additional felicity for the time. I have
 told you how exceedingly good-humoured it made my sister.
 You know how that went off: you know what came on in its place.
 My brother then returned; and we were all wrong again: and Bella, as
 I observed in my letters abovementioned, had an opportunity to give
 herself the credit of having refused Mr. Lovelace, on the score of his
 reputed faulty morals. This united my brother and sister in one cause.
 They set themselves on all occasions to depreciate Mr. Lovelace, and his
 family too (a family which deserves nothing but respect): and this gave
 rise to the conversation I am leading to, between my uncles and them: of
 which I now come to give the particulars; after I have observed, that it
 happened before the rencounter, and soon after the inquiry made into Mr.
 Lovelace's affairs had come out better than my brother and sister hoped
 it would.*
 * See Letter IV.
 They were bitterly inveighing against him, in their usual way,
 strengthening their invectives with some new stories in his disfavour,
 when my uncle Antony, having given them a patient hearing, declared,
 'That he thought the gentleman behaved like a gentleman; his niece Clary
 with prudence; and that a more honourable alliance for the family, as he
 had often told them, could not be wished for: since Mr. Lovelace had a
 very good paternal estate; and that, by the evidence of an enemy,
 all clear. Nor did it appear, that he was so bad a man as he had been
 represented to be: wild indeed; but it was a gay time of life: he was a
 man of sense: and he was sure that his niece would not have him, if
 she had not good reason to think him reformed, or that there was a
 likelihood that she could reform him by her example.'
