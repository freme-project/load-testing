Mentioning that he had only hinted at Mr. Belford's lodgings as an   instance to confirm what he had told her, that he knew of none in
    London fit for her, he says,
 I had a mind to alarm her with something furthest from my purpose; for
 (as much as she disliked my motion) I intend nothing by it: Mrs. Osgood
 is too pious a woman; and would have been more her friend than mine.
 I had a view, moreover, to give her an high opinion of her own sagacity.
 I love, when I dig a put, to have my prey tumble in with secure feet,
 and open eyes: then a man can look down upon her, with an O-ho, charmer,
 how came you there?
 MONDAY, APRIL 17.
 I have just now received a fresh piece of intelligence from my agent,
 honest Joseph Leman. Thou knowest the history of poor Miss Betterton of
 Nottingham. James Harlowe is plotting to revive the resentments of her
 family against me. The Harlowes took great pains, some time ago, to
 endeavour to get to the bottom of that story. But now the foolish devils
 are resolved to do something in it, if they can. My head is working to
 make this booby 'squire a plotter, and a clever fellow, in order to turn
 his plots to my advantage, supposing his sister shall aim to keep me
 at arm's length when in town, and to send me from her. But I will, in
 proper time, let thee see Joseph's letter, and what I shall answer to
 it.* To know in time a designed mischief, is, with me, to disappoint it,
 and to turn it upon the contriver's head.
      * See Letters XLVII., XLVIII. of this volume.
 Joseph is plaguy squeamish again; but I know he only intends by his
 qualms to swell his merits with me. O Belford! Belford! what a vile
 corruptible rogue, whether in poor or rich, is human nature!
 LETTER XXXVI
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO LETTERS
