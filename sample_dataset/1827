its swarms of late-comers, to add to the gathering snowball; who are
 content to take descriptions of our persons, behaviour, and countenances,
 from those who had the good fortune to have been in time to see us.
 * Within these few years past, a passage has been made from the prison to
 the sessions-house, whereby malefactors are carried into court without
 going through the street.  Lovelace's triumph on their supposed march
 shows the wisdom of this alteration.
 Let me tell thee, Jack, I see not why (to judge according to our
 principles and practices) we should not be as much elated in our march,
 were this to happen to us, as others may be upon any other the most mob-
 attracting occasion--suppose a lord-mayor on his gawdy--suppose a
 victorious general, or ambassador, on his public entry--suppose (as I
 began with the lowest) the grandest parade that can be supposed, a
 coronation--for, in all these, do not the royal guard, the heroic
 trained-bands, the pendent, clinging throngs of spectators, with their
 waving heads rolling to-and-fro from house-tops to house-bottoms and
 street-ways, as I have above described, make the principal part of the
 raree-show?
 And let me ask thee, if thou dost not think, that either the mayor, the
 ambassador, or the general would not make very pitiful figures on their
 galas, did not the trumpets and tabrets call together the canaille to
 gaze at them?--Nor perhaps should we be the most guilty heroes neither:
 for who knows how the magistrate may have obtained his gold chain? while
 the general probably returns from cutting of throats, and from murders,
 sanctified by custom only.--Caesar, we are told,* had won, at the age of
 fifty-six, when he was assassinated, fifty pitched battles, had taken by
 assault above a thousand towns, and slain near 1,200,000 men; I suppose
 exclusive of those who fell on his own side in slaying them.  Are not you
 and I, Jack, innocent men, and babes in swaddling-clothes, compared to
 Caesar, and to his predecessor in heroism, Alexander, dubbed, for murders
