ingenuousness, when he can obtain no other, and when the challenged
 proof might bring out, upon discussion, other evils. These, you will
 allow, are severe constructions; but every thing his enemies say of him
 cannot be false.
 I will proceed by-and-by.
 Sometimes we have both thought him one of the most undesigning merely
 witty men we ever knew; at other times one of the deepest creatures
 we ever conversed with. So that when in one visit we have imagined
 we fathomed him, in the next he has made us ready to give him up as
 impenetrable. This impenetrableness, my dear, is to be put among the
 shades in his character. Yet, upon the whole, you have been so far

 over-frankness, and too much regardlessness of appearances, and that he
 is too giddy to be very artful: you would have it, that at the time he
 says any thing good, he means what he speaks; that his variableness and
 levity are constitutional, owing to sound health, and to a soul and body
 [that was your observation] fitted for and pleased with each other. And
 hence you concluded, that could this consentaneousness [as you call it]
 of corporal and animal faculties be pointed by discretion; that is
 to say, could his vivacity be confined within the pale of but moral
 obligations, he would be far from being rejectable as a companion for
 life.
 But I used then to say, and I still am of opinion, that he wants
 a heart: and if he does, he wants every thing. A wrong head may be

 who is but suspected of such a one? What, O what, do parents do, when
 they endeavour to force a child's inclination, but make her think better
 than otherwise she would think of a man obnoxious to themselves, and
