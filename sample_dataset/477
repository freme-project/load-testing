will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to
 without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
 "Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said
 Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
 nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the
 breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
 "We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
 "Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
 I shall communicate with you."
 "Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our
 client, rising.
 "I have solved it."
 "Eh? What was that?"
 "I say that I have solved it."
 "Where, then, is my wife?"
 "That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
 Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
 wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a
 stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
 "It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting
 it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I
 think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
 this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the
 case before our client came into the room."
 "My dear Holmes!"
 "I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
 remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
 served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial
 evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a
 trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
