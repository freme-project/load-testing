 me) to be of the forbearing side? In my mother's case, your observation

 the meanly machinating. He used therefore to inculcate upon me this
 steadiness, upon laudable convictions. And why may I not think that I am

 give up to my brother's ambition the happiness of my future life. Surely
 I ought not to be the instrument of depriving Mr. Solmes's relations of
 their natural rights and reversionary prospects, for the sake of further
 aggrandizing a family (although that I am of) which already lives
