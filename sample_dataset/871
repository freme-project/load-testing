allowed for, as well as others, and who had always valued himself under
 speaking his mind, to curb himself, under such treatment. Nevertheless,
 his consideration for me would make him confine himself, in his
 observations, to facts that were too flagrant, and too openly avowed, to
 be disputed. It could not therefore justly displease, he would venture
 to say, if he made this natural inference from the premises, That

 so much provoked, and of passions so high, and generally thought
 uncontroulable!
 Will you not question me about throbs and glows, if from such instances
