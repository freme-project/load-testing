 heere.*

 Your Honner helped me to many ugly stories to tell against you Honner to
 my younge master, and younge mistriss; but did not tell me about this.
 I most humbelly beseche your Honner to be good and kinde and fethful to
 my deerest younge lady, now you have her; or I shall brake my harte for
 having done some dedes that have helped to bringe things to this passe.
 Pray youre dere, good Honner, be just! Prayey do!--As God shall love ye!

 or so: and yet it is pit such a hedd should be lossed: but if as how
 it should be prossekutid to that furr, which God forbid, be plesed
 natheless to thinck of youre fethful Joseph Leman, before your hedd be
 condemned; for after condemnation, as I have been told, all will be the
 king's or the shreeve's.
 I thote as how it was best to acquent you Honner of this; and for you
