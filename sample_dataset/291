misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
 expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
 "On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to
 believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
 Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
 delighted to hear it," he said.
 "It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has
 really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
 they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some
 letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
 side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
 in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and
 a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other
 characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
 "We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
 and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing
 keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
 "And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
 Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another
 little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
 relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some
 little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come
 from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not
 only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will
 observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen
 other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
 Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
 cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
 he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
 when you have done it."
