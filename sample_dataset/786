I hope it cannot be thought that I would do otherwise.
 My dejection of spirits will give a too just excuse on the score
 of indisposition for avoiding visits. Nor will I, but by distant

 breakfast, that bold creature Betty Barnes, my sister's confidant and
 servant, (if a favourite maid and confidant can be deemed a servant,)
