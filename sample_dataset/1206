He would have thrown himself in my way once more: but I hurried up to my
 prison, in my return from my garden-walk, to avoid him.
 I had, when in the garden, the curiosity to see if my letter were gone:
 I cannot say with an intention to take it back again if it were not,
 because I see not how I could do otherwise than I have done; yet, what a
 caprice! when I found it gone, I began (as yesterday morning) to wish it
 had not: for no other reason, I believe, than because it was out of my
 power.
 A strange diligence in this man!--He says, he almost lives upon the
