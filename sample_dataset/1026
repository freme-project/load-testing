MY DEAR AND EVER-HONOURED UNCLE,
 I have nobody now but you, to whom I can apply, with hope, so much as
 to have my humble addresses opened and read. My aunt Hervey has given me
 commands which I want to have explained; but she has forbid me writing
 to her. Hereupon I took the liberty to write to my father and mother.
 You will see, Sir, by the torn one, and by the other, (both unopened,)
 what has been the result. This, Sir, perhaps you already know: but, as
 you know not the contents of the disgraced letters, I beseech you to
 read them both, that you may be a witness for me, that they are not
 filled with either complaints or expostulations, nor contain any thing
 undutiful. Give me leave to say, Sir, that if deaf-eared anger will
 neither grant me a hearing, nor, what I write a perusal, some time hence
 the hard-heartedness may be regretted. I beseech you, dear, good Sir,
 to let me know what is meant by sending me to my uncle Antony's house,
 rather than to yours, or to my aunt Hervey's, or else-where? If it be
 for what I apprehend it to be, life will not be supportable upon the
 terms. I beg also to know, WHEN I am to be turned out of doors!--My
 heart strongly gives me, that if once I am compelled to leave this
 house, I never shall see it more.
 It becomes me, however, to declare, that I write not this through
 perverseness, or in resentment. God knows my heart, I do not! But the
 treatment I apprehend I shall meet with, if carried to my other uncle's,
 will, in all probability, give the finishing stroke to the distresses,
 the undeserved distresses I will be bold to call them, of
 Your once highly-favoured, but now unhappy, CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER XVI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY MORNING, MARCH 27.
 This morning early my uncle Harlowe came hither. He sent up the enclosed
 very tender letter. It has made me wish I could oblige him. You will see
 how Mr. Solmes's ill qualities are glossed over in it. What blemishes
