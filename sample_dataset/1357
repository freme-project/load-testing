induce you to adhere to your resolution.'--
 But pray, Sir, interrupting him, how came you to apprehend that I should
 revoke my intention? I had indeed deposited a letter to that purpose;
 but you had it not: and how, as I had reserved to myself the privilege
 of a revocation, did you know, but I might have prevailed upon my
 friends, and so have revoked upon good grounds?
 'I will be very ingenuous, Madam--You had made me hope that if you
 changed your mind, you would give me a meeting to apprize me of the
 reasons for it. I went to the loose bricks, and I saw the letter there:
 and as I knew your friends were immovably fixed in their schemes, I
 doubted not but the letter was to revoke or suspend your resolution; and
 probably to serve instead of a meeting too. I therefore let it lie, that
 if you did revoke, you might be under the necessity of meeting me for
 the sake of the expectation you had given me: and as I came prepared, I
 was resolved, pardon me, Madam, whatever were your intentions, that you
 should not go back. Had I taken your letter I must have been determined
 by the contents of it, for the present at least: but not having
 received it, and you having reason to think I wanted not resolution in
 a situation so desperate, to make your friends a personal visit, I
 depended upon the interview you had bid me hope for.'
 Wicked wretch, said I; it is my grief, that I gave you opportunity to
 take so exact a measure of my weakness!--But would you have presumed to
 visit the family, had I not met you?
 Indeed I would. I had some friends in readiness, who were to have
 accompanied me to them. And had your father refused to give me audience,
 I would have taken my friends with me to Solmes.
 And what did you intend to do to Mr. Solmes?
 Not the least hurt, had the man been passive.
 But had he not been passive, as you call it, what would you have done to
 Mr. Solmes?
