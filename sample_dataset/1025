than to
 Your affectionate aunt, DOROTHY HERVEY.
 *****
 Forbid to write to my aunt, I took a bolder liberty. I wrote a few lines
 to my mother; beseeching her to procure me leave to throw myself at my
 father's feet, and hers, if I must go, (nobody else present,) to beg
 pardon for the trouble I had given them both, and their blessings; and
 to receive their commands as to my removal, and the time for it, from
 their own lips.
 'What new boldness this!--Take it back; and bid her learn to obey,' was
 my mother's angry answer, with my letter returned, unopened.
 But that I might omit nothing, that had an appearance of duty, I wrote
 a few lines to my father himself, to the same purpose; begging, that he
 would not turn me out of his house, without his blessing. But this, torn
 in two pieces, and unopened, was brought me up again by Betty, with an
 air, one hand held up, the other extended, the torn letter in her open
 palm; and a See here!--What a sad thing is this!--Nothing will do but
 duty, Miss!--Your papa said, Let her tell me of deeds!--I'll receive no
 words from her. And so he tore the letter, and flung the pieces at my
 head.
 So desperate was my case, I was resolved not to stop even at this
 repulse. I took my pen, and addressed myself to my uncle Harlowe,
 enclosing that which my mother had returned unopened, and the torn
 unopened one sent to my father; having first hurried off a transcript
 for you.
 My uncle was going home, and it was delivered to him just as he stepped
 into his chariot. What may be the fate of it therefore I cannot know
 till to-morrow.
 The following is a copy of it:
 TO JOHN HARLOWE, ESQ.
