might thank myself for all that would follow.
 I sighed. I wept. I was silent.
 Shall I, Clary, said she, shall I tell your father that these
 prohibitions are as unnecessary as I hoped they would be? That you know
 your duty, and will not offer to controvert his will? What say you, my
 love?
 O Madam, what can I say to questions so indulgently put? I do indeed
 know my duty: no creature in the world is more willing to practise
 it: but, pardon me, dearest Madam, if I say, that I must bear these
 prohibitions, if I am to pay so dear to have them taken off.
 Determined and perverse, my dear mamma called me: and after walking
 twice or thrice in anger about the room, she turned to me: Your
 heart free, Clarissa! How can you tell me your heart is free? Such
 extraordinary prepossessions to a particular person must be owing to
 extraordinary prepossessions in another's favour! Tell me, Clary, and
 tell me truly--Do you not continue to correspond with Mr. Lovelace?
 Dearest Madam, replied I, you know my motives: to prevent mischief, I
 answered his letters. The reasons for our apprehensions of this sort are
 not over.
 I own to you, Clary, (although now I would not have it known,) that
 I once thought a little qualifying among such violent spirits was not
 amiss. I did not know but all things would come round again by the
 mediation of Lord M. and his two sisters: but as they all three think
 proper to resent for their nephew; and as their nephew thinks fit to
 defy us all; and as terms are offered, on the other hand, that could
 not be asked, which will very probably prevent your grandfather's estate
 going out of the family, and may be a means to bring still greater into
 it; I see not, that the continuance of your correspondence with him
 either can or ought to be permitted. I therefore now forbid it to you,
 as you value my favour.
