to Lovelace, were I to be sure of his tenderness, and even of his
 reformation, must not the thought of embracing the offered protection of
 his family, be the same thing, in the world's eye, as accepting of his
 own?--Could I avoid receiving his visits at his own relations'? Must I
 not be his, whatever, (on seeing him in a nearer light,) I should find
 him out to be? For you know, it has always been my observation, that
 very few people in courtship see each other as they are. Oh! my dear!
 how wise have I endeavoured to be! How anxious to choose, and to avoid
 every thing, precautiously, as I may say, that might make me happy,
 or unhappy; yet all my wisdom now, by a strange fatality, is likely to
 become foolishness!
 Then you tell me, in your usual kindly-partial manner, what is expected
 of me, more than would be of some others. This should be a lesson to me.
 What ever my motives were, the world would not know them. To complain
 of a brother's unkindness, that, indeed, I might do. Differences between
 brothers and sisters, where interests clash, but too commonly arise:
 but, where the severe father cannot be separated from the faulty
 brother, who could bear to lighten herself, by loading a father?--Then,
 in this particular case, must not the hatred Mr. Lovelace expresses
 to every one of my family (although in return for their hatred of
 him) shock one extremely? Must it not shew, that there is something
 implacable, as well as highly unpolite in his temper?--And what creature
 can think of marrying so as to be out of all hopes ever to be well with
 her own nearest and tenderest relations?
 But here, having tired myself, and I dare say you, I will lay down my
 pen.

 two uncles. Something is working against me, I doubt. What an uneasy
 state is suspense!--When a naked sword, too, seems hanging over one's
