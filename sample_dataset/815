I should be very blamable to endeavour to hide any the least bias
 upon my mind, from you: and I cannot but say--that this man--this
 Lovelace--is a man that might be liked well enough, if he bore such
 a character as Mr. Hickman bears; and even if there were hopes of
 reclaiming him. And further still I will acknowledge, that I believe it
 possible that one might be driven, by violent measures, step by step, as
 it were, into something that might be called--I don't know what to
 call it--a conditional kind of liking, or so. But as to the word
 LOVE--justifiable and charming as it is in some cases, (that is to say,
 in all the relative, in all the social, and, what is still beyond both,
 in all our superior duties, in which it may be properly called divine;)
 it has, methinks, in the narrow, circumscribed, selfish, peculiar sense,
 in which you apply it to me, (the man too so little to be approved of
 for his morals, if all that report says of him be true,) no pretty sound
 with it. Treat me as freely as you will in all other respects, I will
 love you, as I have said, the better for your friendly freedom. But,
 methinks, I could be glad that you would not let this imputation pass so
 glibly from your pen, or your lips, as attributable to one of your own
 sex, whether I be the person or not: since the other must have a double
 triumph, when a person of your delicacy (armed with such contempts of
 them all, as you would have one think) can give up a friend, with an
 exultation over her weakness, as a silly, love-sick creature.
 I could make some other observations upon the contents of your last two
 letters; but my mind is not free enough at present. The occasion for the
 above stuck with me; and I could not help taking the earliest notice of
 them.
 Having written to the end of my second sheet, I will close this letter,
 and in my next, acquaint you with all that has happened here since my
 last.
