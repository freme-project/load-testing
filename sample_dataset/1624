spirit that sent me the spira.
 The sealing of the cover was with black wax.  I hope there is no new
 occasion in the family to give reason for black wax.  But if there were,
 it would, to be sure, have been mentioned, and laid at my door--perhaps
 too justly!
 I had begun a letter to my cousin; but laid it by, because of the
 uncertainty of my situation, and expecting every day for several days
 past to be at a greater certainty.  You bid me write to him some time
 ago, you know.  Then it was I began it: for I have great pleasure in

 now, in the midst of fens and quagmires, it plays around me, and around
 me, throwing me back again, whenever I think myself in the right track.
 But there is one common point, in which all shall meet, err widely as
 they may.  In that I shall be laid quietly down at last: and then will
