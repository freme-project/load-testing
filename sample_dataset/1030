I will tell you, dearest Uncle, what I will do to make my peace. I have
 no doubt that Mr. Solmes, upon consideration, would greatly prefer my
 sister to such a strange averse creature as me. His chief, or one of his
 chief motives in his address to me, is, as I have reason to believe, the
 contiguity of my grandfather's estate to his own. I will resign it; for
 ever I will resign it: and the resignation must be good, because I will
 never marry at all. I will make it over to my sister, and her heirs for
 ever. I shall have no heirs, but my brother and her; and I will receive,
 as of my father's bounty, such an annuity (not in lieu of the estate,
 but as of his bounty) as he shall be pleased to grant me, if it be
 ever so small: and whenever I disoblige him, he to withdraw it, at his
 pleasure.
 Will this not be accepted?--Surely it must--surely it will!--I beg of
 you, dearest Sir, to propose it; and second it with your interest. This
 will answer every end. My sister has a high opinion of Mr. Solmes. I
 never can have any in the light he is proposed to me. But as my sister's
 husband, he will be always entitled to my respect; and shall have it.
 If this be accepted, grant me, Sir, the honour of a visit; and do me
 then the inexpressible pleasure of leading me down to the feet of my
 honoured parents, and they shall find me the most dutiful of children;
 and to the arms of my brother and sister, and they shall find me the
 most obliging and most affectionate of sisters.
 I wait, Sir, for your answer to this proposal, made with the whole heart
 Your dutiful and most obliged niece, CL. HARLOWE.
 MONDAY NOON.
 I hope this will be accepted: for Betty tells me, that my uncle Antony
 and my aunt Hervey are sent for; and not Mr. Solmes; which I look upon
 as a favourable circumstance. With what cheerfulness will I assign over
 this envied estate!--What a much more valuable consideration shall I
 part with it for!--The love and favour of all my relations! That love
