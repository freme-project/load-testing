the name of our landlady.
 I have only, at present, admired them in their dairy-works. How greedily
 do the sex swallow praise!--Did I not once, in the streets of London,
 see a well-dressed, handsome girl laugh, bridle, and visibly enjoy the
 praises of a sooty dog, a chimney-sweeper; who, with his empty sack
 across his shoulder, after giving her the way, stopt, and held up his
 brush and shovel in admiration of her?--Egad, girl, thought I, I
 despise thee as Lovelace: but were I the chimney-sweeper, and could only
 contrive to get into thy presence, my life to thy virtue, I would have
 thee.
 So pleased was I with the young Sorlings, for the elegance of her works,
 that I kissed her, and she made me a courtesy for my condescension; and
 blushed, and seemed sensible all over: encouraging, yet innocently, she
 adjusted her handkerchief, and looked towards the door, as much as to
 say, she would not tell, were I to kiss her again.
 Her eldest sister popt upon her. The conscious girl blushed again, and
 looked so confounded, that I made an excuse for her, which gratified
 both. Mrs. Betty, said I, I have been so much pleased with the neatness
 of your dairy-works, that I could not help saluting your sister: you
 have your share of merit in them, I am sure--Give me leave----
 Good souls!--I like them both--she courtesied too!--How I love a
 grateful temper! O that my Clarissa were but half so acknowledging!
 I think I must get one of them to attend my charmer when she
 removes--the mother seems to be a notable woman. She had not best,
 however, be too notable: since, were she by suspicion to give me a face
 of difficulty to the matter, it would prepare me for a trial with one or
 both the daughters.
 Allow me a little rhodamantade, Jack--but really and truly my heart is
 fixed. I can think of no creature breathing of the sex, but my Gloriana.
