I have promised to give Mr. Lovelace an answer to his proposals as soon
 as I have heard from you, my dear, on the subject.
 I hope that in my next letter I shall have reason to confirm these
 favourable appearances.  Favourable I must think them in the wreck I have
 suffered.
 I hope, that in the trial which you hint may happen between me and
 myself, (as you* express it,) if he should so behave as to oblige me to
 leave him, I shall be able to act in such a manner as to bring no
 discredit upon myself in your eye; and that is all now that I have to
 wish for.  But, if I value him so much as you are pleased to suppose I
 do, the trial, which you imagine will be so difficult to me, will not, I
 conceive, be upon getting from him, when the means to affect my escape
 are lent me; but how I shall behave when got from him; and if, like the
 Israelites of old, I shall be so weak as to wish to return to my Egyptian
 bondage.

 I think it will not be amiss, notwithstanding the present favourable
 appearances, that you should perfect the scheme (whatever it be) which
 you tell me* you have thought of, in order to procure for me an asylum,
 in case of necessity.  Mr. Lovelace is certainly a deep and dangerous
 man; and it is therefore but prudence to be watchful, and to be provided
 against the worst.  Lord bless me, my dear, how I am reduced!--Could I
 ever have thought to be in such a situation, as to be obliged to stay
 with a man, of whose honour by me I could have but the shadow of a doubt!
 --But I will look forward, and hope the best.

 I am certain that your letters are safe.  Be perfectly easy, therefore,
 on that head.
 Mr. Lovelace will never be out of my company by his good will, otherwise
 I have no doubt that I am mistress of my goings-out and comings-in; and
