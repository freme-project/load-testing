to-morrow I shall be at your devotion from day-light to day-light; nor
 will I be at home to any body.
 I have hinted before, that I could almost wish my mother and Mr. Hickman
 would make a match of it: and I here repeat my wishes. What signifies
 a difference of fifteen or twenty years; especially when the lady has
 spirits that will make her young a long time, and the lover is a mighty

 You believe me to be very happy in my prospect in relation to him:
 because you are so very unhappy in the foolish usage you meet with, you
 are apt (as I suspect) to think that tolerable which otherwise would be
