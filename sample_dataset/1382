argue imperfection, something to repent of; we should jog on much
 more equally, and be better able to comprehend one another: and so the
 comfort would be mutual, and the remorse not all on one side.
      He acknowledges that he was greatly affected and pleased
      with the Lady's serious arguments at the time: but even then
      was apprehensive that his temper would not hold.  Thus he
      writes:
 This lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner (and then her
 voice is all harmony when she touches a subject she is pleased with)
 that I could have listened to her for half a day together. But yet I am
 afraid, if she falls, as they call it, she will lose a good deal of that
 pathos, of that noble self-confidence, which gives a good person, as I
 now see, a visible superiority over one not so good.
 But, after all, Belford, I would fain know why people call such
 free-livers as you and me hypocrites.--That's a word I hate; and should
 take it very ill to be called by it. For myself, I have as good motions,
 and, perhaps, have them as frequently as any body: all the business is,
 they don't hold; or, to speak more in character, I don't take the care
 some do to conceal my lapses.
 LETTER XXVII
 MISS HOWE, TO MIS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 15.
 Though pretty much pressed in time, and oppressed by my mother's
 watchfulness, I will write a few lines upon the new light that has
 broken in upon your gentleman; and send it by a particular hand.
 I know not what to think of him upon it. He talks well; but judge him
 by Rowe's lines, he is certainly a dissembler, odious as the sin of
 hypocrisy, and, as he says, that other of ingratitude, are to him.
 And, pray, my dear, let me ask, could he have triumphed, as it is said
 he has done, over so many of our sex, had he not been egregiously guilty
 of both sins?
