something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
 out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
 seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
 because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
 could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
 over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
 her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
 process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
 American. Then who could this American be, and why should he
 possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
 be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
 rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
 before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us
 of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so
 transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
 bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
 significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance
 means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
 claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
 gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
 previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."

 know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
 but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
 settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
