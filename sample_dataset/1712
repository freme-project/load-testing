reasonably expect economy or frugality (or anything indeed but riot and
 waste) from creatures who have an interest, and must therefore have
 views, different from our own?
 They know the uncertain tenure (our fickle humours) by which they hold:
 And is it to be wondered at, supposing them to be provident harlots, that
 they should endeavour, if they have the power, to lay up against a rainy
 day? or, if they have not the power, that they should squander all they
 can come at, when they are sure of nothing but the present hour; and when
 the life they live, and the sacrifices they have made, put conscience and

 Whereas a wife, having the same family-interest with her husband, lies

 children, it goes all into the same family at the long-run.
 Then as to the great article of fidelity to your bed--Are not women of

 for others to attempt her likewise?  For with all her blandishments, can
 any man be so credulous, or so vain, as to believe, that the woman he

 of incurring (legally, at least) that guilt; and you yourself have broken
 through and overthrown in her all the fences and boundaries of moral
 honesty, and the modesty and reserves of her sex: And what tie shall hold
