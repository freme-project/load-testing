        That breathes no wild desires;
      But, taught by thy unerring rules,
      To shun the fruitless wish of fools,
         To nobler views aspires.
      Not Fortune's gem, Ambition's plume,
      Nor Cytherea's fading bloom,
         Be objects of my prayer:
      Let av'rice, vanity, and pride,
      Those envy'd glitt'ring toys divide,
         The dull rewards of care.
      VII.
      To me thy better gifts impart,
      Each moral beauty of the heart,
         By studious thought refin'd;
      For wealth, the smile of glad content;
      For pow'r, its amplest, best extent,
         An empire o'er my mind.
      VIII.
      When Fortune drops her gay parade.
      When Pleasure's transient roses fade,
         And wither in the tomb,
      Unchang'd is thy immortal prize;
      Thy ever-verdant laurels rise
         In undecaying bloom.
      By thee protected, I defy
      The coxcomb's sneer, the stupid lie
         Of ignorance and spite:
      Alike contemn the leaden fool,
      And all the pointed ridicule
         Of undiscerning wit.
