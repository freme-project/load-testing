favour; and he will think light of all he has suffered, or shall suffer,
 in obtaining you.
 Dear, sweet creature, oblige us: and oblige us with a grace. It must be
 done, whether with a grace or not. I do assure you it must. You must not
 conquer father, mother, uncles, every body: depend upon that.
 I have set up half the night to write this. You do not know how I
 am touched at reading yours, and writing this. Yet will I be at
 Harlowe-place early in the morning. So, upon reading this, if you will
 oblige us all, send me word to come up to your apartment: and I will
 lead you down, and present you to the embraces of every one: and you
 will then see, you have more of a brother and sister in them both, than
 of late your prejudices will let you think you have. This from one who
 used to love to style himself,
 Your paternal uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.

 In about an hour after this kind letter was given me, my uncle sent up
 to know, if he should be a welcome visiter, upon the terms mentioned in
 his letter? He bid Betty bring him down a verbal answer: a written one,
 he said, would be a bad sign: and he bid her therefore not to bring a
 letter. But I had just finished the enclosed transcription of one I had
 been writing. She made a difficulty to carry it; but was prevailed upon
 to oblige me by a token which these Mrs. Betty's cannot withstand.
 DEAR AND HONOURED SIR,
 How you rejoice me by your condescending goodness!--So kind, so paternal
 a letter!--so soothing to a wounded heart; and of late what I have been
 so little used to!--How am I affected with it! Tell me not, dear Sir, of
 my way of writing: your letter has more moved me, than I have been able
 to move any body!--It has made me wish, with all my heart, that I could
 entitle myself to be visited upon your own terms; and to be led down to
 my father and mother by so good and so kind an uncle.
