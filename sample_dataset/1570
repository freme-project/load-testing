that she received such their compliments and congratulations with no
 other visible displeasure or repugnance, than such as a young bride, full
 of blushes and pretty confusion, might be supposed to express upon such
 contemplative revolvings as those compliments would naturally inspire.'
 Nor do thou rave at me, Jack, nor rebel.  Dost think I brought the dear
 creature hither for nothing?
 And here's a faint sketch of my plot.--Stand by, varlets--tanta-ra-ra-ra!
 --Veil your bonnets, and confess your master!
 LETTER V
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
 SUNDAY.
 Have been at church, Jack--behaved admirably well too!  My charmer is
 pleased with me now: for I was exceedingly attentive to the discourse,
 and very ready in the auditor's part of the service.--Eyes did not much
 wander.  How could they, when the loveliest object, infinitely the
 loveliest in the whole church, was in my view!
 Dear creature! how fervent, how amiable, in her devotions!  I have got
 her to own that she prayed for me.  I hope a prayer from so excellent a
 mind will not be made in vain.
 There is, after all, something beautifully solemn in devotion.  The
 Sabbath is a charming institution to keep the heart right, when it is
 right.  One day in seven, how reasonable!--I think I'll go to church once
 a day often.  I fancy it will go a great way towards making me a reformed
 man.  To see multitudes of well-appearing people all joining in one
 reverend act.  An exercise how worthy of a rational being!  Yet it adds a
 sting or two to my former stings, when I think of my projects with regard
 to this charming creature.  In my conscience, I believe, if I were to go
 constantly to church, I could not pursue them.
 I had a scheme come into my head while there; but I will renounce it,
 because it obtruded itself upon me in so good a place.  Excellent
