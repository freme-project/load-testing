"'And what are they worth?' I asked.
 "'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,
 and it need not interfere very much with one's other
 occupations.'
 "Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,
 for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an
 extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
 "'Tell me all about it,' said I.
 "'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for
 yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
 where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,
 the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
 Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself
 red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;
 so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
 fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the
 interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
 that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to
 do.'
 "'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who
 would apply.'
 "'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is
 really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had
 started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the
 old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your
 applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but
 real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.
 Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be
 worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a
 few hundred pounds.'
