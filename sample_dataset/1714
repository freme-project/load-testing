world's eye, as well as to your own heart, against tearing yourself from
 such close connections.  She will stick to you as your skin: and it will
 be next to flaying yourself to cast her off.
 Even if there be cause for it, by infidelity, she will have managed ill,
 if she have not her defenders.  Nor did I ever know a cause or a person
 so bad, as to want advocates, either from ill-will to the one, or pity to
 the other: and you will then be thought a hard-hearted miscreant: and
 even were she to go off without credit to herself, she will leave you as

 Well, then, shall this poor privilege, that we may part with a woman if

 thought by us, who are men of family and fortune, an equivalent for

 man cannot boast of, but to his disgrace, nor think of, but to the shame
 of both?
