Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
 disorder.  He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive
 nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
 did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
 action that he could towards them.
 But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
 unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
 The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever
 before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.  Doubtless my
 words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
 of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I
 continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
 indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
 By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
 grieved my friend, I recovered.  I remember the first time I became
 capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I
 perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
 buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.  It was
 a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
 convalescence.  I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
 my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as
 cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.
 "Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how kind, how very good you are to me.
 This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised
 yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.  How shall I ever repay
 you?  I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I
 have been the occasion, but you will forgive me."
 "You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get
 well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I
 may speak to you on one subject, may I not?"
