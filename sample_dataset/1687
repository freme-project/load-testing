reserve, that wishes only, and that for his sake as well as my own, to
 observe due decorum?
 Modesty, I think, required of me, that it should pass as he had put it:
 Did it not?--I think it did.  Would to heaven--but what signifies
 wishing?
 But when he would have rewarded himself, as he had heretofore called it,
 for this self-supposed concession, with a kiss, I repulsed him with a
 just and very sincere disdain.
 He seemed both vexed and surprised, as one who had made the most
 agreeable proposals and concessions, and thought them ungratefully
 returned.  He plainly said, that he thought our situation would entitle
 him to such an innocent freedom: and he was both amazed and grieved to be
 thus scornfully repulsed.
 No reply could be made be me on such a subject.
 I abruptly broke from him.  I recollect, as I passed by one of the pier-
 glasses, that I saw in it his clenched hand offered in wrath to his
 forehead: the words, Indifference, by his soul, next to hatred, I heard
 him speak; and something of ice he mentioned: I heard not what.
 Whether he intends to write to my Lord, or Miss Montague, I cannot tell.
 But, as all delicacy ought to be over with me now, perhaps I am to blame
 to expect it from a man who may not know what it is.  If he does not, and
 yet thinks himself very polite, and intends not to be otherwise, I am
 rather to be pitied, than he to be censured.
 And after all, since I must take him as I find him, I must: that is to
 say, as a man so vain and so accustomed to be admired, that, not being
 conscious of internal defect, he has taken no pains to polish more than
 his outside: and as his proposals are higher than my expectations; and
 as, in his own opinion, he has a great deal to bear from me, I will (no
 new offence preventing) sit down to answer them; and, if possible, in
 terms as unobjectionable to him, as his are to me.
