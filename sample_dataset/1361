what a creature he is whom some of them encourage.
 What you please, Madam, as to that--my service, as well as your
 brother's is now almost over for him. The fellow has made a good hand of
 it. He does not intend to stay long in his place. He is now actually in
 treaty for an inn, which will do his business for life. I can tell
 you further, that he makes love to your sister's Betty: and that by my
 advice. They will be married when he is established. An innkeeper's
 wife is every man's mistress; and I have a scheme in my head to set some
 engines at work to make her repent her saucy behaviour to you to the
 last day of her life.
 What a wicked schemer you are, Sir!--Who shall avenge upon you the still
 greater evils which you have been guilty of? I forgive Betty with all
 my heart. She was not my servant; and but too probably, in what she did,
 obeyed the commands of her to whom she owed duty, better than I obeyed
 those to whom I owed more.
 No matter for that, the wretch said [To be sure, my dear, he must
 design to make me afraid of him]: The decree was gone out--Betty must
 smart--smart too by an act of her own choice. He loved, he said, to
 make bad people their own punishers.--Nay, Madam, excuse me; but if the
 fellow, if this Joseph, in your opinion, deserves punishment, mine is
 a complicated scheme; a man and his wife cannot well suffer separately,
 and it may come home to him too.
 I had no patience with him. I told him so. I see, Sir, said I, I see,
 what a man I am with. Your rattle warns me of the snake.--And away I
 flung: leaving him seemingly vexed, and in confusion.
 LETTER XXII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 My plain-dealing with Mr. Lovelace, on seeing him again, and the free
 dislike I expressed to his ways, his manners, and his contrivances, as
 well as to his speeches, have obliged him to recollect himself a little.
