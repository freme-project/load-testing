ails them that they have not happiness when they have riches, think the
 cause is want of more; and so go on heaping up, till Death, as greedy an
 accumulator as themselves, gathers them into his garner.
 Well then once more I say, do you, my dear, tell me what you know of
 their avowed and general motives; and I will tell you more than you will
 tell me of their failings! Your aunt Hervey, you say,* has told you: Why
 must I ask you to let me know them, when you condescend to ask my advice
 on the occasion?
     * See Letter VIII.
 That they prohibit your corresponding with me, is a wisdom I neither
 wonder at, nor blame them for: since it is an evidence to me, that they
 know their own folly: And if they do, is it strange that they should be
 afraid to trust one another's judgment upon it?
 I am glad you have found out a way to correspond with me. I approve
 it much. I shall more, if this first trial of it prove successful. But
 should it not, and should it fall into their hands, it would not concern
 me but for your sake.
 We have heard before you wrote, that all was not right between your
 relations and you at your coming home: that Mr. Solmes visited you, and
 that with a prospect of success. But I concluded the mistake lay in the
 person; and that his address was to Miss Arabella. And indeed had she
 been as good-natured as your plump ones generally are, I should have
 thought her too good for him by half. This must certainly be the thing,
 thought I; and my beloved friend is sent for to advise and assist in her
 nuptial preparations. Who knows, said I to my mother, but that when
 the man has thrown aside his yellow full-buckled peruke, and his
 broad-brimmed beaver (both of which I suppose were Sir Oliver's best
 of long standing) he may cut a tolerable figure dangling to church
 with Miss Bell!--The woman, as she observes, should excel the man in
 features: and where can she match so well for a foil?
