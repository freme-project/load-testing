own peace, [how harsh to such a wife!] and as I wish, that he does not
 suspect that I secretly favour the address of a vile rake, (a character
 which all the sex, he is pleased to say, virtuous and vicious, are but
 too fond of!) to exert my authority over you: and that this I may the
 less scrupulously do, as you have owned [the old string!] that your
 heart is free.'
 Unworthy reflection in my mother's case, surely, this of our sex's
 valuing a libertine; since she made choice of my father in preference
 to several suitors of equal fortune, because they were of inferior
 reputation for morals!
 'Your father, added she, at his going out, told me what he expected
 from me, in case I found out that I had not the requisite influence upon
 you--It was this--That I should directly separate myself from you, and
 leave you singly to take the consequence of your double disobedience--I
 therefore entreat you, my dear Clarissa, concluded she, and that in the
 most earnest and condescending manner, to signify to your father, on his
 return, your ready obedience; and this as well for my sake as your own.'
 Affected by my mother's goodness to me, and by that part of her argument
 which related to her own peace, and to the suspicions they had of her
 secretly inclining to prefer the man so hated by them, to the man so
 much my aversion, I could not but wish it were possible for me to obey,
 I therefore paused, hesitated, considered, and was silent for some time.
 I could see, that my mother hoped that the result of this hesitation
 would be favourable to her arguments. But then recollecting, that all
 was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister, wholly actuated
 by selfish and envious views; that I had not deserved the treatment I
 had of late met with; that my disgrace was already become the public
 talk; that the man was Mr. Solmes; and that my aversion to him was too
 generally known, to make my compliance either creditable to myself or
 to them: that it would give my brother and sister a triumph over me,
