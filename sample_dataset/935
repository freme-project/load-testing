will shall controul your grandfather's dead one; and that estate will be
 disposed of as your fond grandfather would have disposed of it, had he
 lived to see such a change in his favourite. In a word, Miss, it will be
 kept out of your hands, till my father sees you discreet enough to have
 the management of it, or till you can dutifully, by law, tear it from
 him.
 Fie, Miss Harlowe! said my aunt: this is not pretty to your sister.
 O Madam, let her go on. This is nothing to what I have borne from Miss
 Harlowe. She is either commissioned to treat me ill by her envy, or by
 an higher authority, to which I must submit.--As to revoking the estate,
 what hinders, if I pleased? I know my power; but have not the least
 thought of exerting it. Be pleased to let my father know, that, whatever
 be the consequence to myself, were he to turn me out of doors, (which
 I should rather he would do, than to be confined and insulted as I am),
 and were I to be reduced to indigence and want, I would seek no relief
 that should be contrary to his will.
 For that matter, child, said my aunt, were you to marry, you must do as
 your husband will have you. If that husband be Mr. Lovelace, he will be
 glad of any opportunity of further embroiling the families. And, let
 me tell you, Niece, if he had the respect for you which he pretends to
 have, he would not throw out defiances as he does. He is known to be a
 very revengeful man; and were I you, Miss Clary, I should be afraid he
 would wreak upon me that vengeance, though I had not offended him, which
 he is continually threatening to pour upon the family.
 Mr. Lovelace's threatened vengeance is in return for threatened
 vengeance. It is not every body will bear insult, as, of late, I have
 been forced to bear it.
 O how my sister's face shone with passion!
 But Mr. Lovelace, proceeded I, as I have said twenty and twenty times,
 would be quite out of question with me, were I to be generously treated!
