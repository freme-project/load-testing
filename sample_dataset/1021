 LETTER XV
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY AFTERNOON
 I am in great apprehension. Yet cannot help repeating my humble thanks
 to your mother and you for your last favour. I hope her kind end is
 answered by the contents of my last. Yet I must not think it enough to
 acknowledge her goodness to me, with a pencil only, on the cover of a
 letter sealed up. A few lines give me leave to write with regard to my
 anonymous letter to Lady Drayton. If I did not at that time tell you, as
 I believe I did, that my excellent Mrs. Norton gave me her assistance in
 that letter, I now acknowledge that she did.
 Pray let your mother know this, for two reasons: one, that I may not be
 thought to arrogate to myself a discretion which does not belong to me;
 the other, that I may not suffer by the severe, but just inference she
 was pleased to draw; doubling my faults upon me, if I myself should act
 unworthy of the advice I was supposed to give.
 Before I come to what most nearly affects us all, I must chide you once
 more, for the severe, the very severe things you mention of our family,
 to the disparagement of their MORALS. Indeed, my dear, I wonder at
 you!--A slighter occasion might have passed me, after I had written to
 you so often to so little purpose, on this topic. But, affecting as
 my own circumstances are, I cannot pass by, without animadversion, the
 reflection I need not repeat in words.
 There is not a worthier woman in England than my mother. Nor is my
 father that man you sometimes make him. Excepting in one point, I know
 not any family which lives more up to their duty, than the principals of
 ours. A little too uncommunicative for their great circumstances--that
 is all.--Why, then, have they not reason to insist upon unexceptionable
