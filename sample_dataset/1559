He is accordingly gone out for this purpose.  But I find that he intends
 to take up his lodging here tonight; and if to-night, no doubt on other
 nights, while he is in town.  As the doors and windows of my apartment
 have good fastenings; as he has not, in all this time, given me cause for
 apprehension; as he has the pretence of my brother's schemes to plead; as
 the people below are very courteous and obliging, Miss Horton especially,
 who seems to have taken a great liking to me, and to be of a gentler
 temper and manners than Miss Martin; and as we are now in a tolerable
 way; I imagine it would look particular to them all, and bring me into a
 debate with a man, who (let him be set upon what he will) has always a
 great deal to say for himself, if I were to insist upon his promise: on
 all these accounts, I think, I will take no notice of his lodging here,
 if he don't.--Let me know, my dear, your thoughts of every thing.
 You may believe I gave him back his bank note the moment I saw him.
 FRIDAY EVENING.
 Mr. Lovelace has seen two or three houses, but none to his mind.  But he
 has heard of one which looks promising, he says, and which he is to
 inquire about in the morning.
 SATURDAY MORNING.
 He has made his inquiries, and actually seen the house he was told of
 last night.  The owner of it is a young widow lady, who is inconsolable
 for the death of her husband; Fretchville her name.  It is furnished
 quite in taste, every thing being new within these six months.  He
 believes, if I like not the furniture, the use of it may be agreed for,
 with the house, for a time certain: but, if I like it, he will endeavour
 to take the one, and purchase the other, directly.
 The lady sees nobody; nor are the best apartments above-stairs to be
 viewed, till she is either absent, or gone into the country; which she
 talks of doing in a fortnight, or three weeks, at farthest, and to live
 there retired.
