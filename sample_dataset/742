O Madam! say not my modesty on such an occasion: for that will be to
 give hope--
 And design you not to give hope?--Perverse girl!--Rising and flinging
 from me; take more time for consideration!--Since it is necessary, take
 more time--and when I see you next, let me know what blame I have to
 cast upon myself, or to bear from your father, for my indulgence to you.
 She made, however, a little stop at the chamber-door; and seemed to
 expect that I would have besought her to make the gentlest construction
 for me; for, hesitating, she was pleased to say, I suppose you would not
 have me make a report--
 O Madam, interrupted I, whose favour can I hope for if I lose my
 mamma's?
 To have desired a favourable report, you know, my dear, would have been
 qualifying upon a point that I was too much determined upon, to give
 room for any of my friends to think I have the least hesitation about
 it. And so my mother went down stairs.
 I will deposit thus far; and, as I know you will not think me too minute
 in the relation of particulars so very interesting to one you honour
 with your love, proceed in the same way. As matters stand, I don't care
 to have papers, so freely written, about me.
 Pray let Robert call every day, if you can spare him, whether I have any
 thing ready or not.
 I should be glad you would not send him empty handed. What a generosity
 will it be in you, to write as frequently from friendship, as I am
 forced to do from misfortune! The letters being taken away will be an
 assurance that you have them. As I shall write and deposit as I have
 opportunity, the formality of super and sub-scription will be excused.
 For I need not say how much I am
 Your sincere and ever affectionate, CL. HARLOWE.
