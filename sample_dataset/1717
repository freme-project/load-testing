dozenth, grown as dully sober, as if he had been a real husband, his good
 Mrs. Thomas (for he had not permitted her to take his own name) prevailed
 upon him to think the loss of their children a judgment upon the parents
 for their wicked way of life; [a time will come, Lovelace, if we live to
 advanced years, in which reflection will take hold of the enfeebled
 mind;] and then it was not difficult for his woman to induce him, by way
 of compounding with Heaven, to marry her.  When this was done, he had
 leisure to sit down, and contemplate; an to recollect the many offers of
 persons of family and fortune to which he had declined in the prime of
 life: his expenses equal at least: his reputation not only less, but
 lost: his enjoyments stolen: his partnership unequal, and such as he had
 always been ashamed of.  But the woman said, that after twelve or
 thirteen years' cohabitation, Tony did an honest thing by her.  And that
 was all my poor cousin got by making his old mistress his new wife--not a
 drum, not a trumpet, not a fife, not a tabret, nor the expectation of a
 new joy, to animate him on!
 What Belton will do with his Thomasine I know not! nor care I to advise
 him: for I see the poor fellow does not like that any body should curse
 her but himself.  This he does very heartily.  And so low is he reduced,
 that he blubbers over the reflection upon his past fondness for her cubs,
 and upon his present doubts of their being his: 'What a damn'd thing is
 it, Belford, if Tom and Hal should be the hostler dog's puppies and not
 mine!'
 Very true! and I think the strong health of the chubby-faced muscular
 whelps confirms the too great probability.
 But I say not so to him.
 You, he says, are such a gay, lively mortal, that this sad tale would
 make no impression upon you: especially now, that your whole heart is
 engaged as it is.  Mowbray would be too violent upon it: he has not, he
 says, a feeling heart.  Tourville has no discretion: and, a pretty jest!
