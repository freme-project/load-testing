very high degree of politeness?
 But why, now, when fairer prospects seem to open, why these melancholy
 reflections? will my beloved friend ask of her Clarissa?
 Why?  Can you ask why, my dearest Miss Howe, of a creature, who, in the
 world's eye, had enrolled her name among the giddy and inconsiderate; who
 labours under a parent's curse, and the cruel uncertainties, which must
 arise from reflecting, that, equally against duty and principle, she has

 prospects?  Must it not even rise strongest upon a thoughtful mind, when
 her hopes are the fairest?  Even her pleasures, were the man to prove
 better than she expects, coming to her with an abatement, like that which
 persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth must then most
 poignantly experience (if they have reflecting and unseared minds) when,
 all their wishes answered, (if answered,) they sit down in hopes to enjoy
 what they have unjustly obtained, and find their own reflections their
 greatest torment.
 May you, my dear friend, be always happy in your reflections, prays
 Your ever affectionate
 CL. HARLOWE.

    far, he cannot, he says, forbear trying, according to the resolution
    he had before made, whether he cannot go farther.
 He gives the particulars of their debates on the above-mentioned
