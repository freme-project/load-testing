the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
 Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his
 literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.  He
 came to the university with the design of making himself complete
 master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
 the plan of life he had marked out for himself.  Resolved to pursue no
 inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
 scope for his spirit of enterprise.  The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
 languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
 the same studies.  Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
 wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt
 great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not

 did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
 I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
 amusement.  I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well

 friends.  My return had only been delayed so long, from an
 unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become
 acquainted with any of its inhabitants.  The winter, however, was spent
