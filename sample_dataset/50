I trembled.  One subject!  What could it be?  Could he allude to an
 object on whom I dared not even think?  "Compose yourself," said
 Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I will not mention it if it
 agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they
 received a letter from you in your own handwriting.  They hardly know
 how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence."
 "Is that all, my dear Henry?  How could you suppose that my first
 thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and
 who are so deserving of my love?"
 "If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to
 see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from
 your cousin, I believe."
 Chapter 6
 Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.  It was from my
 own Elizabeth:
 "My dearest Cousin,
 "You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
 kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.  You are
 forbidden to write--to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,
 is necessary to calm our apprehensions.  For a long time I have thought
 that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
 restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  I have
 prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
 long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to
 perform it myself!  I figure to myself that the task of attending on
 your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
 guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
 your poor cousin.  Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed
 you are getting better.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this
 intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
