I had tolerably recovered myself, with a settled and haughty gloom upon
 his brow--Your father and mother command you instantly to prepare for
 your uncle Antony's. You need not be solicitous about what you shall
 take with you: you may give Betty your keys--Take them, Betty, if the
 perverse one has them about her, and carry them to her mother. She will
 take care to send every thing after you that you shall want--but another
 night you will not be permitted to stay in this house.
 I don't choose to give my keys to any body, except to my mother, and
 into her own hands.--You see how much I am disordered. It may cost me
 my life, to be hurried away so suddenly. I beg to be indulged till next
 Monday at least.
 That will not be granted you. So prepare for this very very night.
 And give up your keys. Give them to me, Miss. I'll carry them to your
 mother.
 Excuse me, Brother. Indeed I won't.
 Indeed you must. Have you any thing you are afraid should be seen by
 your mother?
 Not if I be permitted to attend her.
 I'll make a report accordingly.
 He went out.
 In came Miss Dolly Hervey: I am sorry, Madam, to be the messenger--but
 your mamma insists upon your sending up all the keys of your cabinet,
 library, and drawers.
 Tell my mother, that I yield them up to her commands: tell her, I
 make no conditions with my mother: but if she finds nothing she shall
 disapprove of, I beg that she will permit me to tarry here a few days
 longer.--Try, my Dolly, [the dear girl sobbing with grief;] try if your
 gentleness cannot prevail for me.
 She wept still more, and said, It is sad, very sad, to see matters thus
 carried!
