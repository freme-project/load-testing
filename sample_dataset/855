the trial. But you'll see nothing will do. My brother has taken his
 measures too securely.
 TO ROGER SOLMES, ESQ. WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15.
 SIR,
 You will wonder to receive a letter from me; and more still at the
 uncommon subject of it. But the necessity of the case will justify me,
 at least in my own apprehension; and I shall therefore make no other
 apology for it.
 When you first came acquainted with our family, you found the writer of
 this one of the happiest creatures in the world; beloved by the best
 and most indulgent of parents; and rejoicing in the kind favour of two
 affectionate uncles, and in the esteem of every one.
 But how is this scene now changed!--You was pleased to cast a favourable
 eye upon me. You addressed yourself to my friends: your proposals were
 approved of by them--approved of without consulting me; as if my choice
 and happiness were of the least signification. Those who had a right to
 all reasonable obedience from me, insisted upon it without reserve.
 I had not the felicity to think as they did; almost the first time my
 sentiments differed from theirs. I besought them to indulge me in a
 point so important to my future happiness: but, alas, in vain! And then
 (for I thought it was but honest) I told you my mind; and even that
 my affections were engaged. But, to my mortification and surprise, you
 persisted, and still persist.
 The consequence of all is too grievous for me to repeat: you, who have
 such free access to the rest of the family, know it too well--too well
 you know it, either for the credit of your own generosity, or for my
 reputation. I am used, on your account, as I never before was used, and
 never before was thought to deserve to be used; and this was the hard,
 the impossible, condition of their returning favour, that I must prefer
 a man to all others, that of all others I cannot prefer.
