sufferer a less degree of warmth in her own cause, than you have for
 her, because of the endeavours to divest herself of self so far as to
 leave others to the option which they have a right to make!--Ought I, my
 dear, to blame, ought I not rather to admire you for this ardor?
 But nevertheless, lest you should think that there is any foundation for
 a surmise which (although it owe its rise to your friendship) would, if
 there were, leave me utterly inexcusable, I must, in justice to myself,
 declare, that I know not my own heart if I have any of that latent or
 unowned inclination, which you would impute to any other but me. Nor
 does the important alternative sit lightly on my mind. And yet I must
 excuse your mother, were it but on this single consideration, that
 I could not presume to reckon upon her favour, as I could upon her
 daughter's, so as to make the claim of friendship upon her, to whom, as
 the mother of my dearest friend, a veneration is owing, which can
 hardly be compatible with that sweet familiarity which is one of the
 indispensable requisites of the sacred tie by which your heart and mine
 are bound in one.
 What therefore I might expect from my Anna Howe, I ought not from
 her mother; for would it not be very strange, that a person of her
 experience should be reflected upon because she gave not up her own
 judgment, where the consequence of her doing so would be to embroil
 herself, as she apprehends, with a family she has lived well with,
 and in behalf of a child against her parents?--as she has moreover a
 daughter of her own:--a daughter too, give me leave to say, of whose
 vivacity and charming spirits she is more apprehensive than she need to
 be, because her truly maternal cares make her fear more from her youth,
 than she hopes for her prudence; which, nevertheless, she and all the
 world know to be beyond her years.
 And here let me add, that whatever you may generously, and as the result
 of an ardent affection for your unhappy friend, urge on this head, in my
