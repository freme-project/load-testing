when she aimed to be worse tempered than ordinary.
 How they managed it in their next conversation I know not. One would be
 tempted to think by the issue, that Mr. Lovelace was ungenerous enough
 to seek the occasion given,* and to improve it. Yet he thought fit to
 put the question too:--But, she says, it was not till, by some means
 or other (she knew not how) he had wrought her up to such a pitch of
 displeasure with him, that it was impossible for her to recover herself
 at the instant. Nevertheless he re-urged his question, as expecting
 a definitive answer, without waiting for the return of her temper,
 or endeavouring to mollify her; so that she was under a necessity of
 persisting in her denial: yet gave him reason to think she did not
 dislike his address, only the manner of it; his court being rather made
 to her mother than to herself, as if he was sure of her consent at any
 time.
      * See Mr. Lovelace's Letter, No. XXXI, in which he briefly
      accounts for his conduct in this affair.
 A good encouraging denial, I must own: as was the rest of her plea; to
 wit, 'A disinclination to change her state. Exceedingly happy as she
 was: she never could be happier!' And such-like consenting negatives,
 as I may call them, and yet not intend a reflection upon my sister: for
 what can any young creature in the like circumstances say, when she is
 not sure but a too-ready consent may subject her to the slights of a sex
 that generally values a blessing either more or less as it is obtained
 with difficulty or ease? Miss Biddulph's answer to a copy of verse from
 a gentleman, reproaching our sex as acting in disguise, is not a bad
 one, although you may perhaps think it too acknowledging for the female
 character.
  Ungen'rous Sex!--To scorn us if we're kind;
    And yet upbraid us if we seem severe!
  Do you, t' encourage us to tell our mind,
