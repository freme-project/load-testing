 The principal difference that strikes me in the comparison between us and
 the mayor, the ambassador, the general, on their gawdies, is, that the
 mob make a greater noise, a louder huzzaing, in the one case than the

 So thou seest the worst that can happen, should we not make the grand
 tour upon this occasion, but stay and take our trials.  But it is most
 likely, that they will not prosecute at all.  If not, no risque on our
 side will be run; only taking our pleasure abroad, at the worst; leaving
