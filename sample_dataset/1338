Then, what a triumph would it be to the Harlowe pride, were I now to
 marry this lady? A family beneath my own! No one in it worthy of an
 alliance with but her! My own estate not contemptible! Living within the
 bounds of it, to avoid dependence upon their betters, and obliged to no
 man living! My expectations still so much more considerable! My person,
 my talents--not to be despised, surely--yet rejected by them with scorn.
 Obliged to carry on an underhand address to their daughter, when two of

 I have declined, partly for her sake, and partly because I never will
 marry; if she be not the person. To be forced to steal her away, not
 only from them, but from herself! And must I be brought to implore
 forgiveness and reconciliation from the Harlowes?--Beg to be

 riches? As a brother to a wretch, who has conceived immortal hatred to
 me; and to a sister who was beneath my attempts, or I would have had her
 in my own way, and that with a tenth part of the trouble and pains that
 her sister has cost me; and, finally, as a nephew to uncles, who value
 themselves upon their acquired fortunes, would insult me as creeping
 to them on that account?--Forbid it in the blood of the Lovelaces, that
 your last, and, let me say, not the meanest of your stock, should thus
 creep, thus fawn, thus lick the dust, for a WIFE--!
 Proceed anon.
 LETTER XVIII
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]
 But is it not the divine CLARISSA [Harlowe let me not say; my soul
 spurns them all but her] whom I am thus by application threatening?--If
 virtue be the true nobility, how is she ennobled, and how shall an
 alliance with her ennoble, were not contempt due to the family from whom
 she sprang and prefers to me!
 But again, let me stop.--Is there not something wrong, has there
