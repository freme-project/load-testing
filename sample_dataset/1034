these fine things. One desires to be excused, it seems: another chooses
 not to have any thing to say to me: another has enough of me: and of
 writing to so ready a scribbler, there will be no end.
 Thus are those imputed qualifications, which used so lately to gain me
 applause, now become my crimes: so much do disgust and anger alter the
 property of things.
 The result of their debate, I suppose, will somehow or other be
 communicated to me by-and-by. But let me tell you, my dear, that I am
 made so desperate, that I am afraid to open Mr. Lovelace's letter,
 lest, in the humour I am in, I should do something (if I find it not
 exceptionable) that may give me repentance as long as I live.
 MONDAY NIGHT.
 This moment the following letter is brought me by Betty.
 MONDAY, 5 O'CLOCK
 MISS CUNNING-ONE,
 Your fine new proposal is thought unworthy of a particular answer. Your
 uncle Harlowe is ashamed to be so taken in. Have you no new fetch for
 your uncle Antony? Go round with us, child, now your hand's in. But I
 was bid to write only one line, that you might not complain, as you
 did of your worthy sister, for the freedoms you provoked: It is
 this--Prepare yourself. To-morrow you go to my uncle Antony's. That's
 all, child.
 JAMES HARLOWE.
 I was vexed to the heart at this: and immediately, in the warmth of
 resentment, wrote the enclosed to my uncle Harlowe; who it seems stays
 here this night.
 TO JOHN HARLOWE, ESQ. MONDAY NIGHT.
 HONOURED SIR,
 I find I am a very sad creature, and did not know it. I wrote not to my
 brother. To you, Sir, I wrote. From you I hope the honour of an answer.
