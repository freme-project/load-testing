easy manner of expressing his sentiments on all occasions.  He seems to
 delight in a logical way of argumentation, as also does Mr. Belton.
 These two attacked each other in this way; and both looked at us women,
 as if to observe whether we did not admire this learning, or when they
 had said a smart thing, their wit.  But Mr. Belford had visibly the
 advantage of the other, having quicker parts, and by taking the worst
 side of the argument, seemed to think he had.  Upon the whole of his
 behaviour and conversation, he put me in mind of that character of
 Milton:--
                              --------His tongue
       Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear

 self, and did not endeavour to distinguish what is the essence of right
 and wrong, look becoming in him.
 Mr. Belford, to my no small vexation and confusion, with the forwardness
 of a favoured and intrusted friend, singled me out, on Mr. Lovelace's
