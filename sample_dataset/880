see what their next step will be, and what course you will take upon it;
 and then we may be the more enlightened.
 As to your change of style to your uncles, and brother and sister, since
 they were so fond of attributing to you a regard for Lovelace, and would
 not be persuaded to the contrary; and since you only strengthened their
 arguments against yourself by denying it; you did but just as I would
 have done, in giving way to their suspicions, and trying what that would

 But let it--if it must be Lovelace or Solmes, the choice cannot admit of
 debate. Yet if all be true that is reported, I should prefer almost any
 of your other lovers to either; unworthy as they also are. But who can
