would resent the contempt she brought upon herself in my chamber. Her
 conduct surely can only be accounted for by the rage instigate by a
 supposed rivalry.
 TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE
 I am to tell you, that your mother has begged you off for the morrow:
 but that you have effectually done your business with her, as well as
 with every body else.
 In your proposals and letter to your brother, you have shewn yourself so
 silly, and so wise; so young, and so old; so gentle, and so obstinate;
 so meek, and so violent; that never was there so mixed a character.
 We all know of whom you have borrowed this new spirit. And yet the seeds
 of it must be in your heart, or it could not all at once shew itself so
 rampant. It would be doing Mr. Solmes a spite to wish him such a shy,
 un-shy girl; another of your contradictory qualities--I leave you to
 make out what I mean by it.
 Here, Miss, your mother will not let you remain: she cannot have any
 peace of mind while such a rebel of a child is so near her. Your aunt
 Hervey will not take a charge which all the family put together cannot
 manage. Your uncle Harlowe will not see you at his house, till you are
 married. So, thanks to your own stubbornness, you have nobody that will
 receive you but your uncle Antony. Thither you must go in a very
 few days; and, when there, your brother will settle with you, in my
 presence, all that relates to your modest challenge; for it is accepted,
 I assure you. Dr. Lewen will possibly be there, since you make choice of
 him. Another gentleman likewise, were it but to convince you, that he is
 another sort of man than you have taken him to be. Your two uncles
 will possibly be there too, to see that the poor, weak, and defenceless
 sister has fair play. So, you see, Miss, what company your smart
 challenge will draw together.
 Prepare for the day. You'll soon be called upon. Adieu, Mamma Norton's
