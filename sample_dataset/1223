     Ver. 3 If a woman vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself
      by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
      4. And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she
      hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at

 read, and then sign, the settlements.--That, that must be the greatest
 trial of all.
 If I am compelled to sign them over-night--then (the Lord bless me!)
 must all I dread follow, as of course, on Wednesday. If I can prevail
 upon them by my prayers [perhaps I shall fall into fits; for the very
 first appearance of my father, after having been so long banished his
 presence, will greatly affect me--if, I say, I can prevail upon them by
 my prayers] to lay aside their views; or to suspend the day, if but for
 one week; but if not, but for two or three days; still Wednesday will
 be a lighter day of trial. They will surely give me time to consider: to
 argue with myself. This will not be promising. As I have made no
 effort to get away, they have no reason to suspect me; so I may have an
