At worst, will he confine me prisoner to my chamber? Will he deny me the
 visits of my dearest friend, and forbid me to correspond with her? Will
 he take from me the mistressly management, which I had not faultily
 discharged? Will he set a servant over me, with license to insult me?
 Will he, as he has not a sister, permit his cousins Montague, or would
 either of those ladies accept of a permission, to insult and tyrannize
 over me?--It cannot be.--Why then, think I often, do you tempt me, O my

 such a man to the paths of virtue and honour: to be a secondary means,
 if I were to be his, of saving him, and preventing the mischiefs so
 enterprising a creature might otherwise be guilty of, if he be such a
 one.
 When I have thought of him in these lights, (and that as a man of sense
 he will sooner see his errors, than another,) I own to you, that I have
 had some difficulty to avoid taking the path they so violently endeavour
 to make me shun: and all that command of my passions which has been
 attributed to me as my greatest praise, and, in so young a creature, as
 my distinction, has hardly been sufficient for me.
 And let me add, that the favour of his relations (all but himself
 unexceptionable) has made a good deal of additional weight, thrown in
 the same scale.
 But now, in his disfavour. When I have reflected upon the prohibition
 of my parents; the giddy appearance, disgraceful to our sex, that such
 a preference would have: that there is no manner of likelihood, enflamed
 by the rencounter, and upheld by art and ambition on my brother's side,
 that ever the animosity will be got over: that I must therefore be at
 perpetual variance with all my own family: that I must go to him, and to
 his, as an obliged and half-fortuned person: that his aversion to them
 all is as strong as theirs to him: that his whole family are hated
