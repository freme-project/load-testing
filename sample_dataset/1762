please ye!--I remember the motion: but her back was towards me at the
 time.*  Are these watchful ladies all eye?--But observe what follows; 'I
 wish it had been a poll-axe, and in the hands of his worst enemy.'--
 * She tells Miss Howe, that she saw this motion in the pier-glass.  See
 Letter XXXIII. of this volume.
 I will have patience, Jack; I will have patience!  My day is at hand.--
 Then will I steel my heart with these remembrances.
 But here is a scheme to be thought of, in order to 'get my fair prize out
 of my hands, in case I give her reason to suspect me.'
 This indeed alarms me.  Now the contention becomes arduous.  Now wilt
 thou not wonder, if I let loose my plotting genius upon them both.  I
 will not be out-Norris'd, Belford.
 But once more, 'She has no notion,' she says, 'that I can or dare to mean
 her dishonour.  But then the man is a fool--that's all.'--I should indeed
 be a fool, to proceed as I do, and mean matrimony!--'However, since you
 are thrown upon a fool,' says she, 'marry the fool at the first
 opportunity; and though I doubt that this man will be the most
 unmanageable of fools, as all witty and vain fools are, take him as a
 punishment, since you cannot as a reward.'--Is there any bearing this,
 Belford?
 But, 'such men as myself, are the men that women do not naturally hate.'
 --True as the gospel, Jack!--The truth is out at last.  Have I not always
 told thee so?  Sweet creatures and true christians these young girls!
 They love their enemies.  But rakes in their hearts all of them!  Like
 turns to like; that's the thing.  Were I not well assured of the truth of
 this observation of the vixen, I should have thought it worth while, if
 not to be a good man, to be more of an hypocrite, than I found it needful
 to be.
 But in the letter I came at to-day, while she was at church, her scheme
 is further opened; and a cursed one it is.
