will do, or what I have done, on this or that occasion; the resolution
 or action is before me either to be adhered to, withdrawn, or amended;
 and I have entered into compact with myself, as I may say; having given
 it under my own hand to improve, rather than to go backward, as I live
 longer.
 I would willingly, therefore, write to you, if I might; the rather as it
 would be the more inspiriting to have some end in view in what I write;
 some friend to please; besides merely seeking to gratify my passion for
 scribbling.
 But why, if your mother will permit our correspondence on communicating
 to her all that passes in it, and if she would condescend to one only
 condition, may it not be complied with?
 Would she not, do you think, my dear, be prevailed upon to have the
 communication made to her, in confidence?
 If there were any prospect of a reconciliation with my friends, I should
 not have so much regard for my pride, as to be afraid of any body's
 knowing how much I have been outwitted as you call it. I would in that
 case (when I had left Mr. Lovelace) acquaint your mother, and all my own
 friends, with the whole of my story. It would behove me so to do, for my
 own reputation, and for their satisfaction.
 But, if I have no such prospect, what will the communication of my
 reluctance to go away with Mr. Lovelace, and of his arts to frighten
 me away, avail me? Your mother has hinted, that my friends would insist
 upon my returning home to them (as a proof of the truth of my plea)
 to be disposed of, without condition, at their pleasure. If I scrupled
 this, my brother would rather triumph over me, than keep my secret. Mr.
 Lovelace, whose pride already so ill brooks my regrets for meeting him,
 (when he thinks, if I had not, I must have been Mr. Solmes's wife,)
 would perhaps treat me with indignity: and thus, deprived of all refuge
 and protection, I should become the scoff of men of intrigue; a disgrace
