the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the
 light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
 and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the
 brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
 forecastle of an emigrant ship.
 Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
 in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads
 thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a
 dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black
 shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,
 now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
 the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to
 themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,
 monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then
 suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
 thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At
 the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside
 which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
 man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon
 his knees, staring into the fire.
 As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
 for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
 "Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend
 of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
 There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and
 peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and
 unkempt, staring out at me.
 "My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of
 reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what
 o'clock is it?"
