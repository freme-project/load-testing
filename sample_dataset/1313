heart to be honest to my Clarissa!--There's a prayer, Jack! If I should
 not be heard, what a sad thing would that be, for the most admirable of
 women!--Yet, as I do no often trouble Heaven with my prayers, who knows
 but this may be granted?
 But there lie before me such charming difficulties, such scenery for
 intrigue, for stratagem, for enterprize. What a horrible thing, that my
 talents point all that way!--When I know what is honourable and just;
 and would almost wish to be honest?--Almost, I say; for such a varlet am
 I, that I cannot altogether wish it, for the soul of me!--Such a triumph
 over the whole sex, if I can subdue this lady! My maiden vow, as I may
 call it!--For did not the sex begin with me? And does this lady spare
 me? Thinkest thou, Jack, that I should have spared my Rosebud, had I
 been set at defiance thus?--Her grandmother besought me, at first, to
 spare her Rosebud: and when a girl is put, or puts herself into a
 man's power, what can he wish for further? while I always considered
 opposition and resistance as a challenge to do my worst.*
      * See Vol. I. Letter XXXIV.
 Why, why, will the dear creature take such pains to appear all ice to
 me?--Why will she, by her pride, awaken mine?--Hast thou not seen, in
 the above, how contemptibly she treats me?--What have I not suffered
 for her, and even from her!--Ought I to bear being told, that she will
 despise me, if I value myself above that odious Solmes?
 Then she cuts me short in all my ardours. To vow fidelity, is by a
 cursed turn upon me, to shew, that there is reason, in my own opinion,
 for doubt of it. The very same reflection upon me once before.*
      * See Vol. II. Letter XIII.
 In my power, or out of my power, all one to this lady.--So, Belford, my
 poor vows are crammed down my throat, before they can well rise to my
 lips. And what can a lover say to his mistress, if she will neither let
 him lie nor swear?
