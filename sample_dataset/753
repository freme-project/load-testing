In my answer, I absolutely declare, as I tell him I have often done,
 'That he is to expect no favour from me against the approbation of my
 friends: that I am sure their consents for his visiting any of them
 will never be obtained: that I will not be either so undutiful, or so
 indiscreet, as to suffer my interests to be separated from the interests
 of my family, for any man upon earth: that I do not think myself obliged
 to him for the forbearance I desire one flaming spirit to have with
 others: that in this desire I require nothing of him, but what prudence,
 justice, and the laws of his country require: that if he has any
 expectations of favour from me, on that account, he deceives himself:
 that I have no inclination, as I have often told him, to change my
 condition: that I cannot allow myself to correspond with him any longer
 in this clandestine manner: it is mean, low, undutiful, I tell him; and
 has a giddy appearance, which cannot be excused: that therefore he is
 not to expect that I will continue it.
 To this in his last, among other things, he replies, 'That if I am
 actually determined to break off all correspondence with him, he must
 conclude, that it is with a view to become the wife of a man, whom no
 woman of honour and fortune can think tolerable. And in that case, I
 must excuse him for saying, that he shall neither be able to bear the
 thoughts of losing for ever a person in whom all his present and all his
 future hopes are centred; nor support himself with patience under the
 insolent triumphs of my brother upon it. But that nevertheless he will
 not threaten either his own life, or that of any other man. He must take
 his resolutions as such a dreaded event shall impel him at the time. If
 he shall know that it will have my consent, he must endeavour to resign
 to his destiny: but if it be brought about by compulsion, he shall not
 be able to answer for the consequence.'
 I will send you these letters for your perusal in a few days. I would
 enclose them; but that it is possible something may happen, which may
