of my promise, as he called it. His motion was so sudden, that I was not
 aware of it. It would have looked affected to be very angry; yet I could
 not be pleased, considering this as a leading freedom, from a spirit so
 audacious and encroaching: and he might see, that I was not.
 He passed all that by with an air peculiar to himself--Enough, enough,
 dearest Madam! And now let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful
 uneasiness, which gives me to apprehend too much for my jealous love to
 bear; and it shall be my whole endeavour to deserve your favour, and to
 make you the happiest woman in the world; as I shall be the happiest of
 men.
 I broke from him to write to you my preceding letter; but refused to
 send it by his servant, as I told you. The mistress of the house helped
 me to a messenger, who was to carry what you should give him to Lord
 M.'s seat in Hertfordshire, directed for Mrs. Greme, the housekeeper
 there. And early in the morning, for fear of pursuit, we were to set
 out that way: and there he proposed to change the chariot and six for a
 chaise and pair of his own, which he had at that seat, as it would be a
 less-noticed conveyance.
 I looked over my little stock of money; and found it to be no more
 than seven guineas and some silver: the rest of my stock was but fifty
 guineas, and that five more than I thought it was, when my sister
 challenged me as to the sum I had by me:* and those I left in my
 escritoire, little intending to go away with him.
      * See Vol. I. Letter XLIII.
 Indeed my case abounds with a shocking number of indelicate
 circumstances. Among the rest, I was forced to account to him, who knew
 I could have no clothes but what I had on, how I came to have linen with
 me (for he could not but know I sent for it); lest he should imagine
 I had an early design to go away with him, and made that part of the
 preparation.
