declarations, I could not tell tem, how far matters had gone between you
 and your fellow?--When the intention is to bend that stubborn will of
 yours to your duty, do you think I would deceive them?--Do you think I
 would encourage them to call you down, to contradict all that I should
 have invented in your favour?
 Well, well, Bella; I am the less obliged to you; that's all. I was
 willing to think that I had still a brother and sister. But I find I am
 mistaken.
 Pretty mopsy-eyed soul!--was her expression!--And was it willing to
 think it had still a brother and sister? And why don't you go on, Clary?
 [mocking my half-weeping accent] I thought I had a father, and mother,
 two uncles, and an aunt: but I am mis--taken, that's all--come, Clary,
 say this, and it will in part be true, because you have thrown off all
 their authority, and because you respect one vile wretch more than them
 all.
 How have I deserved this at your hands, Sister?--But I will only say, I
 pity you.
 And with that disdainful air too, Clary!--None of that bridled neck!
 none of your scornful pity, girl!--I beseech you!
 This sort of behaviour is natural to you, surely, Bella!--What new
 talents does it discover in you!--But proceed--If it be a pleasure to
 you, proceed, Bella. And since I must not pity you, I will pity myself:
 for nobody else will.
 Because you don't, said she--
 Hush, Bella, interrupting her, because I don't deserve it--I know you
 were going to say so. I will say as you say in every thing; and that's
 the way to please you.
 Then say, Lovelace is a villain.
 So I will, when I think him so.
 Then you don't think him so?
