perhaps whose character will not stand examination?
 I have said, that I think Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man: upon my word, I
 have sometimes doubted, whether his perseverance in his addresses to
 me has not been the more obstinate, since he has found himself so
 disagreeable to my friends. From that time I verily think he has
 been the more fervent in them; yet courts them not, but sets them at
 defiance. For this indeed he pleads disinterestedness [I am sure he
 cannot politeness]; and the more plausibly, as he is apprized of the
 ability they have to make it worth his while to court them. 'Tis true
 he has declared, and with too much reason, (or there would be no bearing
 him,) that the lowest submissions on his part would not be accepted; and
 to oblige me, has offered to seek a reconciliation with them, if I would
 give him hope of success.
 As to his behaviour at church, the Sunday before last, I lay no stress
 upon that, because I doubt there was too much outward pride in his
 intentional humility, or Shorey, who is not his enemy, could not have
 mistaken it.
 I do not think him so deeply learned in human nature, or in ethics, as
 some have thought him. Don't you remember how he stared at the following
 trite observations, which every moralist could have furnished him with?
 Complaining as he did, in a half-menacing strain, of the obloquies
 raised against him--'That if he were innocent, he should despise the
 obloquy: if not, revenge would not wipe off his guilt.' 'That nobody
 ever thought of turning a sword into a sponge!' 'That it was in his own
 power by reformation of an error laid to his charge by an enemy, to make
 that enemy one of his best friends; and (which was the noblest revenge
 in the world) against his will; since an enemy would not wish him to be
 without the faults he taxed him with.'
 But the intention, he said, was the wound.
 How so, I asked him, when that cannot wound without the application?
