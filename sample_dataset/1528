In this sweetly familiar way shall we set out together for London.
 Mrs. Sorlings's eldest daughter, at my motion, is to attend her in the
 chaise, while I ride by way of escort: for she is extremely apprehensive
 of the Singleton plot; and has engaged me to be all patience, if any
 thing should happen on the road. But nothing I am sure will happen:
 for, by a letter received just now from Joseph, I understand, that
 James Harlowe has already laid aside his stupid project: and this by the
 earnest desire of all those of his friends to whom he had communicated
 it; who were afraid of the consequences that might attend it. But it is
 not over with me, however; although I am not determined at present as to
 the uses I may make of it.
 My beloved tells me, she shall have her clothes sent her. She hopes also
 her jewels, and some gold, which she left behind her: but Joseph says,
 clothes only will be sent. I will not, however, tell her that: on the
 contrary, I say, there is no doubt but they will send all she wrote
 for. The greater her disappointment from them, the greater must be her
 dependence on me.
 But, after all, I hope I shall be enabled to be honest to a merit so
 transcendent. The devil take thee, though, for thy opinion, given so
 mal-a-propos, that she may be overcome.
 If thou designest to be honest, methinkst thou sayest, Why should not
 Singleton's plot be over with thee, as it is with her brother?
 Because (if I must answer thee) where people are so modestly doubtful of
 what they are able to do, it is good to leave a loop-hole. And, let me
 add, that when a man's heart is set upon a point, and any thing occurs
 to beat him off, he will find it very difficult, when the suspending
 reason ceases, to forbear resuming it.
