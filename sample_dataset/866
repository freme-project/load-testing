 Or sleep dissembling, while he waits his prey,
  His fearless foes within his distance draws,

  Till at the last, his time for fury found,
  He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:
  The prostrate vulgar passes o'er, and spares,
  But, with a lordly rage, his hunter tears.

 which supported the old roof, I should have sunk.
 I had hitherto, as you know, kept him at a distance: And now, as I
 recovered myself, judge of my first emotions, when I recollected his
 character from every mouth of my family; his enterprising temper; and
 found myself alone with him, in a place so near a bye-lane, and so
 remote from the house.
 But his respectful behaviour soon dissipated these fears, and gave me
 others; lest we should be seen together, and information of it given to
 my brother: the consequences of which, I could readily think, would be,
