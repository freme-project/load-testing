contempt, as from indigence--all, then, that admits of debate between my
 beloved and me is only this--which of the two has more wit, more
 circumspection--and that remains to be tried.
 A sad life, however, this life of doubt and suspense, for the poor lady
 to live, as well as for me; that is to say, if she be not naturally
 jealous--if she be, her uneasiness is constitutional, and she cannot help
 it; nor will it, in that case, hurt her.  For a suspicious temper will
 make occasion for doubt, if none were to offer to its hand.  My fair one
 therefore, if naturally suspicious, is obliged to me for saving her the
 trouble of studying for these occasions--but, after all, the plainest
 paths in our journeys through life are the safest and best I believe,
 although it is not given me to choose them; I am not, however, singular
 in the pursuit of the more intricate paths; since there are thousands,
 and ten thousands, who had rather fish in troubled waters than in smooth.

 one of the most perverse.  I never was supposed to be an ill-natured
 mortal neither.  How can it be?  I imagined, for a long while, that we
 were born to make each other happy: but quite the contrary; we really
 seem to be sent to plague each other.
 I will write a comedy, I think: I have a title already; and that's half
 the work.  The Quarrelsome Lovers. 'Twill do.  There's something new and
 striking in it.  Yet, more or less, all lovers quarrel.  Old Terence has
 taken notice of that; and observes upon it, That lovers falling out
 occasions lovers falling in; and a better understanding of course.  'Tis
 natural that it should be so.  But with us, we fall out so often, without
 falling in once; and a second quarrel so generally happens before a first
