How poor to withhold from you your books, your jewels, and your money!
 As money is all you can at present want, since they will vouchsafe
 to send your clothes, I send fifty guineas by the bearer, enclosed in
 single papers in my Norris's Miscellanies. I charge you, as you love me,

 I have more at your service. So, if you like not your lodgings or his
 behaviour when you get to town, leave both them and him out of hand.
 I would advise you to write to Mr. Morden without delay. If he intends
 for England, it may hasten him. And you will do very well till he can
 come. But, surely Lovelace will be infatuated, if he secure not his
 happiness by your consent, before that of Mr. Morden's is made needful
 on his arrival.
 Once more, my dear, let me beg of you to be comforted. Manage with
 your usual prudence the stake before you, and all will still be happy.
 Suppose yourself to be me, and me to be you, [you may--for your distress
 is mine,] and then you will add full day to these but glimmering lights
 which are held out to you by
 Your ever affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.
 I hurry this away by Robert. I will inquire into the truth of your
 aunt's pretences about the change of measures which she says they
 intended in case you had not gone away.

 me with the company of her eldest daughter, at Mr. Lovelace's request,
 while he rides by us. The young gentlewoman is to return in two or three
