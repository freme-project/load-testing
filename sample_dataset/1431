I am unhappy that I cannot have my worthy Hannah. I am sorry for the
 poor creature's illness as for my own disappointment by it. Come, my
 dear Miss Howe, since you press me to be beholden to you: and would
 think me proud if I absolutely refused your favour; pray be so good as
 to send her two guineas in my name.
 If I have nothing for it, as you say, but matrimony, it yields little
 comfort, that his relations do not despise the fugitive, as persons of
 their rank and quality-pride might be supposed to do, for having been a
 fugitive.
 But O my cruel, thrice cruel uncle! to suppose--but my heart checks my
 pen, and will not let it proceed, on an intimation so extremely shocking
 as that which he supposes!--Yet, if thus they have been persuaded, no
 wonder if they are irreconcilable.
 This is all my hard-hearted brother's doings!--His surmisings:--God
 forgive him--prays his injured sister!
 LETTER XXXVIII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY, APRIL 20.
 Mr. Lovelace's servant is already returned with an answer from his
 friend Mr. Doleman, who has taken pains in his inquiries, and is very
 particular. Mr. Lovelace brought me the letter as soon as he had read
 it: and as he now knows that I acquaint you with every thing that he
 offers, I desired him to let me send it to you for your perusal. Be
 pleased to return it by the first opportunity. You will see by it, that
 his friends in town have a notion that we are actually married.
 TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. TUESDAY NIGHT, APRIL 18.
 DEAR SIR,
 I am extremely rejoiced to hear, that we shall so soon have you in town
 after so long an absence. You will be the more welcome still, if what
 report says, be true; which is, that you are actually married to the
 fair lady upon whom we have heard you make such encomiums. Mrs. Doleman,
