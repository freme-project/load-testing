constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,
 I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
 Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
 "I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I
 was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and
 hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would
 be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
 Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together
 with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
 fear."
 "That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
 "Good God! What a week she must have spent!"
 "The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,
 "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
 post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
 customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
 "That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
 of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
 "Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
 "It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are
 to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
 "I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
 "In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps
 may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.
 I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for
 having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your
 results."
 "I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
 pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if
 we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
