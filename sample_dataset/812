You will permit me, my dear, to touch upon a few passages in your last
 letter, that affect me sensibly.
 In the first place, you must allow me to say, low as I am in spirits,
 that I am very angry with you, for your reflections on my relations,
 particularly on my father and mother, and on the memory of my
 grandfather. Nor, my dear, does your own mother always escape the keen
 edge of your vivacity. One cannot one's self forbear to write or speak
 freely of those we love and honour, when grief from imagined hard
 treatment wrings the heart: but it goes against one to hear any body
 else take the same liberties. Then you have so very strong a manner of
 expression where you take a distaste, that when passion has subdued,
 and I come (upon reflection) to see by your severity what I have given
 occasion for, I cannot help condemning myself.
 But least of all can I bear that you should reflect upon my mother.
 What, my dear, if her meekness should not be rewarded? Is the want of
 reward, or the want even of a grateful acknowledgement, a reason for us
 to dispense with what we think our duty? They were my father's lively
 spirits that first made him an interest in her gentle bosom. They were
 the same spirits turned inward, as I have heretofore observed,* that
 made him so impatient when the cruel malady seized him. He always loved
 my mother: And would not LOVE and PITY excusably, nay laudably, make a
 good wife (who was an hourly witness of his pangs, when labouring under
 a paroxysm, and his paroxysms becoming more and more frequent, as well
 as more and more severe) give up her own will, her own likings,
 to oblige a husband, thus afflicted, whose love for her was
 unquestionable?--And if so, was it not too natural [human nature is not
 perfect, my dear] that the husband thus humoured by the wife, should be
 unable to bear controul from any body else, much less contradiction from
 his children?
