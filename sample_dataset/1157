which having been seen when the great search was made, she was bid to
 ask for.
 As it happened, I had not diminished it, having hid half a dozen crow
 quills in as many different places. It was lucky; for I doubt not they
 had numbered how many were in the parcel.
 Betty ran on, telling me, that my mother was now as much incensed
 against me as any body--that my doom was fixed--that my violent
 behaviour had not left one to plead for me--that Mr. Solmes bit his lip,
 and muttered, and seemed to have more in his head, than could come out
 at his mouth; that was her phrase.
 And yet she also hinted to me, that the cruel wretch took pleasure
 in seeing me; although so much to my disgust--and so wanted to see me
 again.--Must he not be a savage, my dear?
 The wench went on--that my uncle Harlowe said, That now he gave me
 up--that he pitied Mr. Solmes--yet hoped he would not think of this
 to my detriment hereafter: that my uncle Antony was of opinion, that
 I ought to smart for it: and, for her part--and then, as one of the
 family, she gave her opinion of the same side.
 As I have no other way of hearing any thing that is said or intended
 below, I bear sometimes more patiently than I otherwise should do with
 her impertinence. And indeed she seems to be in all my brother's and
 sister's counsels.
 Miss Hervey came up again, and demanded an half-pint ink-bottle which
 they had seen in my closet.
 I gave it her without hesitation.
 If they have no suspicion of my being able to write, they will perhaps
 let me stay longer than otherwise they would.
 This, my dear, is now my situation.
 All my dependence, all my hopes, are in your mother's favour. But for
 that, I know not what I might do: For who can tell what will come next?
