you how much she still loves you; and what she expects of you on
 the approaching occasion. But yet, that she may not be exposed to an
 opposition which would the more provoke her, she desires that you will
 first assure her that you go down with a resolution to do that with a
 grace which must be done with or without a grace. And besides, she wants
 to give you some advice how to proceed in order to reconcile yourself
 to your father, and to every body else. Will you go down, Miss Clary, or
 will you not?
 I said, I should think myself happy, could I be admitted to my mother's
 presence, after so long a banishment from it; but that I could not wish
 it upon those terms.
 And this is your answer, Niece?
 It must be my answer, Madam. Come what may, I never will have Mr.
 Solmes. It is cruel to press this matter so often upon me.--I never will
 have that man.
 Down she went with displeasure. I could not help it. I was quite tired
 with so many attempts, all to the same purpose. I am amazed that they
 are not!--So little variation! and no concession on either side!
 I will go down and deposit this; for Betty has seen I have been writing.
 The saucy creature took a napkin, and dipt it in water, and with a
 fleering air, here, Miss; holding the wet corner to me.
 What's that for? said I.
 Only, Miss, one of the fingers of your right-hand, if you please to look
 at it.
 It was inky.
 I gave her a look; but said nothing.
 But, lest I should have another search, I will close here.
 CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER XLI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY, ONE O'CLOCK.
