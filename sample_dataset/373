In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
 from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey
 side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the
 river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the
 right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well
 known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted
 him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
 "Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
 "Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
 "Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come
 down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged
 jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."
 "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small,
 office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a
 telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
 desk.
 "What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
 "I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged
 with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.
 Clair, of Lee."
 "Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
 "So I heard. You have him here?"
 "In the cells."
 "Is he quiet?"
 "Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
 "Dirty?"
 "Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
 face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been
 settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you
 saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
