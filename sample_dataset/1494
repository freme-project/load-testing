to make further trial, knowing what we know of the sex, for fear of
 succeeding; and especially if I doubted not, that if there were a woman
 in the world virtuous at heart, it is she.
 And let me tell thee, Lovelace, that in this lady's situation, the
 trial is not a fair trial. Considering the depth of thy plots and
 contrivances: considering the opportunities which I see thou must have
 with her, in spite of her own heart; all her relations' follies acting
 in concert, though unknown to themselves, with thy wicked, scheming
 head: considering how destitute of protection she is: considering the
 house she is to be in, where she will be surrounded with thy implements;
 specious, well-bred and genteel creatures, not easily to be detected
 when they are disposed to preserve appearances, especially by the young
 inexperienced lady wholly unacquainted with the town: considering all
 these things, I say, what glory, what cause of triumph wilt thou have,
 if she should be overcome?--Thou, too, a man born for intrigue, full
 of invention, intrepid, remorseless, able patiently to watch for thy
 opportunity, not hurried, as most men, by gusts of violent passion,
 which often nip a project in the bud, and make the snail, that was just
 putting out his horns to meet the inviter, withdraw into its shell--a
 man who has no regard to his word or oath to the sex; the lady
 scrupulously strict to her word, incapable of art or design; apt
 therefore to believe well of others--it would be a miracle if she stood
 such an attempter, such attempts, and such snares, as I see will be
 laid for her. And, after all, I see not when men are so frail without
 importunity, that so much should be expected from women, daughters of
 the same fathers and mothers, and made up of the same brittle compounds,
 (education all the difference,) nor where the triumph is in subduing
 them.
 May there not be other Lovelaces, thou askest, who, attracted by her
 beauty, may endeavour to prevail with her?*
