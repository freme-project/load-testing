will not let me think of with patience; all aggravated by the contents of
 my cousin's affecting letter; you will not wonder that the vapourishness
 which has laid hold of my heart should rise to my pen.  And yet it would
 be more kind, more friendly in me, to conceal from you, who take such a
 generous interest in my concerns, that worst part of my griefs, which
 communication and complaint cannot relieve.
 But to whom can I unbosom myself but to you: when the man who ought to be
 my protector, as he has brought upon me all my distresses, adds to my
 apprehensions; when I have not even a servant on whose fidelity I can
 rely, or to whom I can break my griefs as they arise; and when his
 bountiful temper and gay heart attach every one to him; and I am but a
 cipher, to give him significance, and myself pain!--These griefs,
 therefore, do what I can, will sometimes burst into tears; and these
 mingling with my ink, will blot my paper.  And I know you will not grudge
 me the temporary relief.
 But I shall go on in the strain I left off with in my last, when I
 intended rather to apologize for my melancholy.  But let what I have
 above written, once for all, be my apology.  My misfortunes have given
 you a call to discharge the noblest offices of the friendship we have
 vowed to each other, in advice and consolation; and it would be an injury
 to it, and to you, to suppose it needed even that call.

    continually teasing her to go abroad with him in a coach, attended by
    whom she pleases of her own sex, either for the air, or to the public
    diversions.
 She gives the particulars of a conversation that has passed between them
    on that subject, and his several proposals.  But takes notice, that he
    says not the least word of the solemnity which he so much pressed for
    before they came to town; and which, as she observes, was necessary to
    give propriety to his proposals.]
