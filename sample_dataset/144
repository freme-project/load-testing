only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
 me whilst they endured.
 After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
 many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two days for
 Clerval.  He came.  Alas, how great was the contrast between us!  He
 was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
 setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
 day.  He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
 the appearances of the sky.  "This is what it is to live," he cried;
 "how I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are
 you desponding and sorrowful!" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
 thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
 sunrise reflected in the Rhine.  And you, my friend, would be far more
 amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
 eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a

 We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to
 Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this
 voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
 We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
 Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz
 becomes much more picturesque.  The river descends rapidly and winds
 between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.  We saw
 many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
 black woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rhine, indeed,
 presents a singularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view
 rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
 the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
 flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
