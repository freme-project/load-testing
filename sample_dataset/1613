confraternity, whose constant course of life, even long before I became
 your general, to this hour, has justified what ye now in a fit of
 squeamishness, and through envy, condemn.  Having, therefore, vindicated

 for.
 Be convinced, then, that I (according to our principles) am right, thou

 LETTER XVIII
 MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
 EDGEWARE, THURSDAY, MAY 4.
 I know that thou art so abandoned a man, that to give thee the best
 reasons in the world against what thou hast once resolved upon will be
 but acting the madman whom once we saw trying to buffet down a hurricane
 with his hat. I hope, however, that the lady's merit will still avail her

 sweet lamb which thou hast singled out from a flock thou hatest, for the
 faults of the dogs who kept it: if thou art not to be moved by beauty, by

 find I have not the honour of the lady's good opinion.  And the more, when
 I reflect upon her father's brutal curse, and the villainous hard-

 to know (if thou wilt proceed) by what gradations, arts, and contrivances
 thou effectest thy ingrateful purpose.  And, O Lovelace, I conjure thee,
 if thou art a man, let not the specious devils thou has brought her among
 be suffered to triumph over her; yield to fair seductions, if I may so
