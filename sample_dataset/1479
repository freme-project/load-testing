so hardhearted as they be, for all my younge master and younge mistress
 sayes.
 And here is the sad thing; they cannot come to clere up matters with my
 deerest young lady, because, as your Honner has ordered it, they have
 these stories as if bribed by me out of your Honner's sarvant; which
 must not be known for fere you should kill'n and me too, and blacken the
 briber!--Ah! your Honner! I doubte as tha I am a very vild fellow, (Lord
 bless my soil, I pray God!) and did not intend it.
 But if my deerest younge lady should come to harm, and plese your
 Honner, the horsepond at the Blew Bore--but Lord preserve us all from
 all bad mischeff, and all bad endes, I pray the Lord!--For tho'ff you
 Honner is kinde to me in worldly pelf, yet what shall a man get to loos
 his soul, as holy Skrittuer says, and plese your Honner?
 But natheless I am in hope of reppentence hereafter, being but a younge
 man, if I do wrong thro' ignorens: your Honner being a grate man, and a
 grave wit; and I a poor crature, not worthy notice; and your Honner able
 to answer for all. But, howsomever, I am
 Your Honner's fetheful sarvant in all dewtie, JOSEPH LEMAN.

 LETTER XLVIII
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOSEPH LEMAN MONDAY, APRIL 17.
 HONEST JOSEPH,
 You have a worse opinion of your invention than you ought to have.
 I must praise it again. Of a plain man's head, I have not known many
 better than yours. How often have your forecast and discretion answered
 my wishes in cases which I could not foresee, not knowing how my general
 directions would succeed, or what might happen in the execution of them!
 You are too doubtful of your own abilities, honest Joseph; that's your
 fault.--But it being a fault that is owing to natural modesty, you ought
 rather to be pitied for it than blamed.
