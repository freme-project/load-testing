for me; and tauntings and revilings used on purpose to make a handle of
 my words against me, when I am not permitted to speak in my own defence.
 I conclude with hoping, that my brother's instigations may not rob an
 unhappy child of her father.
 This is the answer, sent without superscription, and unsealed, although
 by Betty Barnes, who delivered it with an air, as if she knew the
 contents.
 WEDNESDAY.
 I write, perverse girl; but with all the indignation that your
 disobedience deserves. To desire to be forgiven a fault you own, and
 yet resolve to persevere in, is a boldness, no more to be equaled,
 than passed over. It is my authority you defy. Your reflections upon a
 brother, that is an honour to us all, deserve my utmost resentment. I
 see how light all relationship sits upon you. The cause I guess at,
 too. I cannot bear the reflections that naturally arise from this
 consideration. Your behaviour to your too-indulgent and too-fond
 mother----But, I have no patience--Continue banished from my presence,
 undutiful as you are, till you know how to conform to my will.
 Ingrateful creature! Your letter but upbraid me for my past indulgence.
 Write no more to me, till you can distinguish better; and till you are
 convinced of your duty to
 A JUSTLY INCENSED FATHER.
 This angry letter was accompanied by one from my mother, unsealed, and
 unsuperscribed also. Those who take so much pains to confederate every
 one against me, I make no doubt, obliged her to bear her testimony
 against the poor girl.
 My mother's letter being a repetition of some of the severe things that
 passed between herself and me, of which I have already informed you, I
 shall not need to give you the contents--only thus far, that she also
 praises my brother, and blames me for my freedoms with him.
