return to my chamber, in a fit of passionate despair, I tore almost in
 two the answer I had written to his proposals.
 I will see him in the morning, because I promised I would.  But I will go
 out, and that without him, or any attendant.  If he account not tolerably
 for his sudden change of behaviour, and a proper opportunity offer of a
 private lodging in some creditable house, I will not any more return to
 this:--at present I think so.--And there will I either attend the
 perfecting of your scheme; or, by your epistolary mediation, make my own
 terms with the wretch; since it is your opinion, that I must be his, and
 cannot help myself: or, perhaps, take a resolution to throw myself at
 once into Lady Betty's protection; and this will hinder him from making
 his insolently-threatened visit to Harlowe-place.
 [The Lady writes again on Monday evening; and gives her friend an account
    of all that passed between herself and Mr. Lovelace that day; and of
    her being terrified out of her purpose, of going out: but Mr.
    Lovelace's next letters giving a more ample account of all, hers are
    omitted.
 It is proper, however, to mention, that she re-urges Miss Howe (from the
    dissatisfaction she has reason for from what passed between Mr.
    Lovelace and herself) to perfect her scheme in relation to Mrs.
    Townsend.  She concludes this letter in these words:]
 I should say something of your last favour (but a few hours ago received)
 and of your dialogue with your mother--Are you not very whimsical, my
 dear?  I have but two things to wish for on this occasion.--The one, that
 your charming pleasantry had a better subject than that you find for it
 in this dialogue--the other, that my situation were not such, as must too
 often damp that pleasantry in you, and will not permit me to enjoy it, as
 I used to do.  Be, however, happy in yourself, though you cannot in
 Your
 CLARISSA HARLOWE.
