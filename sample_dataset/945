things to me in behalf of my submitting to my father's will, that her
 arguments have not a little contributed to make me resolve to avoid the
 extremities, which nevertheless I pray to God they do not at last force
 me upon. And yet they deprive me of her advice, and think unjustly of
 one of the most excellent of women.
 I am glad to hear you say this: and take this, and this, and this, my
 charming Niece! (for so she called me almost at every word, kissing me
 earnestly, and clasping her arms about my neck:) and God protect you,
 and direct you! But you must submit: indeed you must. Some one day in a
 month from this is all the choice that is left you.
 And this, I suppose, was the doom my sister called for; and yet no worse
 than what had been pronounced upon me before.
 She repeated these last sentences louder than the former. 'And remember,
 Miss,' added she, 'it is your duty to comply.'--And down she went,
 leaving me with my heart full, and my eyes running over.
 The very repetition of this fills me with almost equal concern to that
 which I felt at the time.
 I must lay down my pen. Mistiness, which give to the deluged eye the
 appearance of all the colours in the rainbow, will not permit me to
 write on.
 WEDNESDAY, FIVE O'CLOCK
 I will now add a few lines--My aunt, as she went down from me, was met
 at the foot of the stairs by my sister, who seemed to think she had
 staid a good while after her; and hearing her last words prescribing
 to me implicit duty, praised her for it, and exclaimed against my
 obstinacy. Did you ever hear of such perverseness, Madam? said she:
 Could you have thought that your Clarissa and every body's Clarissa, was
 such a girl?--And who, as you said, is to submit, her father or she?
 My aunt said something in answer to her, compassionating me, as I
 thought, by her accent: but I heard not the words.
