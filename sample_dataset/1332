Then, Jack, thou wilt have a merit too in engaging my pen, since thy
 time would be otherwise worse employed: and, after all, who knows but by
 creating new habits, at the expense of the old, a real reformation may
 be brought about? I have promised it; and I believe there is a pleasure
 to be found in being good, reversing that of Nat. Lee's madman,

 and then thou wilt have reason doubly and trebly to thank me, as well
 because of thy present delight, as with regard to thy prospect beyond
 the moon.
 To this place I had written, purely to amuse myself, before I was
 admitted to my charmer. But now I have to tell thee, that I was quite
