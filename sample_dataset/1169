your Anna Howe, if you allow her to be your companion in affliction.
 I will engage, my dear, we shall not be in town together one month,
 before we surmount all difficulties; and this without being beholden to
 any men-fellows for their protection.
 I must repeat what I have often said, that the authors of your
 persecutions would not have presumed to set on foot their selfish
 schemes against you, had they not depended upon the gentleness of your
 spirit; though now, having gone so far, and having engaged Old AUTHORITY
 in it, [chide me if you will!] neither he nor they know how to recede.
 When they find you out of their reach, and know that I am with you,
 you'll see how they'll pull in their odious horns.
 I think, however, that you should have written to your cousin Morden,

 not suffer them quietly to carry you to your uncle's: And whose must you
 be, if he succeeds in taking you from them?

 I tremble for you but upon supposing what may be the consequence of a
 conflict upon this occasion. Lovelace owes some of them vengeance. This
 gives me a double concern, that my mother should refuse her consent to
 the protection I had set my heart upon procuring for you.
