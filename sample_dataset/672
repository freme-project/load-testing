relations, hath assured me, that she hath, as well by deed of gift as
 by will, left him both her Scottish and English estates: for never
 was there a family more prosperous in all its branches, blessed be God
 therefore: and as my said son James will very probably make it up to
 my grand-daughter Arabella; to whom I intend no disrespect; nor have
 reason; for she is a very hopeful and dutiful child: and as my sons,
 John and Antony, seem not inclined to a married life; so that my son
 James is the only one who has children, or is likely to have any. For
 all these reasons; and because my dearest and beloved grand-daughter
 Clarissa hath been from her infancy a matchless young creature in her
 duty to me, and admired by all who knew her, as a very extraordinary
 child; I must therefore take the pleasure of considering her as my own
 peculiar child; and this without intending offence; and I hope it
 will not be taken as any, since my son James can bestow his favours
 accordingly, and in greater proportion, upon his son James, and upon his
 daughter Arabella.--
 These, I say, are the reasons which move me to dispose of the
 above-described estate in the precious child's favour; who is the
 delight of my old age: and, I verily think, has contributed, by her
 amiable duty and kind and tender regards, to prolong my life.
 Wherefore it is my express will and commandment, and I enjoin my said
 three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James, and my
 grand-daughter Arabella, as they value my blessing, and will regard my
 memory, and would wish their own last wills and desires to be fulfilled
 by their survivors, that they will not impugn or contest the following
 bequests and devises in favour of my said grand-daughter Clarissa,
 although they should not be strictly conformable to law or to the forms
 thereof; nor suffer them to be controverted or disputed on any pretence
 whatsoever.
 And in this confidence, &c. &c. &c.
