care of our watchful and natural guardians and protectors.
 Hard as you may suppose it, to be denied to continuance of a
 correspondence once so much approved, even by the venerable denier;
 yet, if your mother think my fault to be of such a nature, as that a
 correspondence with me will cast a shade upon your reputation, all my
 own friends having given me up--that hardship is to be submitted to. And
 must it not make her the more strenuous to support her own opinion, when
 she sees the first fruits of this tenaciousness on your side is to
 be gloriously in the sullens, as you call it, and in a disobedient
 opposition?
 I know that you have a humourous meaning in that expression, and that
 this turn, in most cases, gives a delightful poignancy both to your
 conversation and correspondence; but indeed, my dear, this case will not
 bear humour.
 Will you give me leave to add to this tedious expostulation, that I by
 no means approve of some of the things you write, in relation to the
 manner in which your father and mother lived--at times lived--only at
 times, I dare say, though perhaps too often.
 Your mother is answerable to any body, rather than to her child, for
 whatever was wrong in her conduct, if any thing was wrong, towards Mr.
 Howe: a gentleman, of whose memory I will only say, that it ought to be
 revered by you--But yet, should you not examine yourself, whether your
 displeasure at your mother had no part in your revived reverence for
 your father at the time you wrote?
 No one is perfect: and although your mother may not be right to remember
 disagreeableness against the departed, yet should you not want to be
 reminded on whose account, and on what occasion, she remembered them.
 You cannot judge, nor ought you to attempt to judge, of what might
 have passed between both, to embitter and keep awake disagreeable
 remembrances in the survivor.
