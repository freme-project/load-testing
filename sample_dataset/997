of going to reside at The Grove: I suppose, with a design to make
 ejectments necessary, were I to offer at assuming; or, were I to marry
 Mr. Lovelace, in order to give him all the opposition and difficulty the
 law would help him to give.
 These cases I have put to myself, for argument-sake: but they are
 all out of the question, although any body were to be found who would
 espouse my cause: for I do assure you, I would sooner beg my bread, than
 litigate for my right with my father: since I am convinced, that whether
 the parent do his duty by the child or not, the child cannot be excused
 from doing hers to him. And to go to law with my father, what a
 sound has that! You will see, that I have mentioned my wish (as an
 alternative, and as a favour) to be permitted, if I must be put out of
 his house, to go thither: but not one step further can I go. And you see
 how this is resented.
 Upon the whole, then, what have I to hope for, but a change in my
 father's resolution?--And is there any probability of that; such an
 ascendancy as my brother and sister have obtained over every body;
 and such an interest to pursue the enmity they have now openly avowed
 against me?
 As to Mr. Lovelace's approbation of your assumption-scheme, I wonder not
 at. He very probably penetrates the difficulties I should have to bring
 it to effect, without his assistance. Were I to find myself as free as I
 would wish myself to be, perhaps Mr. Lovelace would stand a worse chance
 with me than his vanity may permit him to imagine; notwithstanding the
 pleasure you take in rallying me on his account. How know you, but
 all that appears to be specious and reasonable in his offers; such as,
 standing his chance for my favour, after I became independent, as I may
 call it [by which I mean no more, than to have the liberty of refusing
 for my husband a man whom it hurts me but to think of in that light];
 and such as his not visiting me but by my leave; and till Mr. Morden
