he would escape, did she not lessen the little merit he has, by giving
 him, on all occasions, more than I think he can deserve, and entering
 him into comparisons in which it is impossible but he must be a
 sufferer. And now [preposterous partiality!] she thought for her part,
 that Mr. Hickman, bating that his face indeed was not so smooth, nor his
 complexion quite so good, and saving that he was not so presuming and
 so bold (which ought to be no fault with a modest woman) equaled Mr.
 Lovelace at any hour of the day.
 To avoid entering further into such an incomparable comparison, I said,
 I did not believe, had they left you to your own way, and treated you
 generously, that you would have had the thought of encouraging any man
 whom they disliked--
 Then, Nancy, catching me up, the excuse is less--for if so, must there
 not be more of contradiction, than love, in the case?
 Not so, neither, Madam: for I know Miss Clarissa Harlowe would prefer
 Mr. Lovelace to all men, if morals--
 IF, Nancy!--That if is every thing.--Do you really think she loves Mr.
 Lovelace?
 What would you have had me say, my dear?--I won't tell you what I did
 say: But had I not said what I did, who would have believed me?
 Besides, I know you love him!--Excuse me, my dear: Yet, if you deny it,
 what do you but reflect upon yourself, as if you thought you ought not
 to allow yourself in what you cannot help doing?
 Indeed, Madam, said I, the man is worthy of any woman's love [if, again,
 I could say]--But her parents--
 Her parents, Nancy--[You know, my dear, how my mother, who accuses her
 daughter of quickness, is evermore interrupting one!]
 May take wrong measures, said I--
 Cannot do wrong--they have reason, I'll warrant, said she--
 By which they may provoke a young woman, said I, to do rash things,
