LETTER XLVII
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
 MONDAY MORNING, MAY 22.
 No generosity in this lady.  None at all.  Wouldst thou not have thought,
 that after I had permitted her to withdraw, primed for mischief as I was,
 she would meet me next morning early; and that with a smile; making me
 one of her best courtesies?
 I was in the dining-room before six, expecting her.  She opened not her
 door.  I went up stairs and down; and hemm'd; and called Will.; called
 Dorcas; threw the doors hard to; but still she opened not her door.  Thus
 till half an hour after eight, fooled I away my time; and then (breakfast
 ready) I sent Dorcas to request her company.
 But I was astonished, when (following the wench, as she did at the first
 invitation) I saw her enter dressed, all but her gloves, and those and
 her fan in her hand; in the same moment bidding Dorcas direct Will. to
 get her a chair to the door.
 Cruel creature, thought I, to expose me thus to the derision of the women
 below!
 Going abroad, Madam!
 I am, Sir.
 I looked cursed silly, I am sure.  You will breakfast first, I hope,
 Madam; and a very humble strain; yet with an hundred tender looks in my
 heart.
 Had she given me more notice of her intention, I had perhaps wrought
 myself up to the frame I was in the day before, and begun my vengeance.
 And immediately came into my head all the virulence that had been
 transcribed for me from Miss Howe's letters, and in that letter which I
 had transcribed myself.
 Yes, she would drink one dish; and then laid her gloves and fan in the
 window just by.
