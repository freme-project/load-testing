your aunt, my dear, who loves you so well?
 She owned, that she came to expostulate with me, for the peace-sake of
 the family: for that she could not believe it possible, if I did not
 conceive myself unkindly treated, that I, who had ever shewn such a
 sweetness of temper, as well as manners, should be thus resolute, in a
 point so very near to my father, and all my friends. My mother and she
 were both willing to impute my resolution to the manner I had been begun

 arguments that passed on both sides.--So I will only recite what she was
 pleased to say, that carried with it a new face.
 When she found me inflexible, as she was pleased to call it, she said,

 Ay, Clary, put in my sister, what say you to Mr. Wyerley?
 I saw through this immediately. It was said on purpose, I doubted
 not, to have an argument against me of absolute prepossession in Mr.
 Lovelace's favour: since Mr. Wyerley every where avows his value, even
 to veneration, for me; and is far less exceptionable both in person and
