before you as I go along, that you may be the better able to advise me
 in this dreadful crisis.
 'He begs my pardon for writing with so much assurance; attributing it to
 his unbounded transport; and entirely acquiesces to me in my will. He is
 full of alternatives and proposals. He offers to attend me directly to
 Lady Betty's; or, if I had rather, to my own estate; and that my Lord
 M. shall protect me there.' [He knows not, my dear, my reasons for
 rejecting this inconsiderate advice.] 'In either case, as soon as he
 sees me safe, he will go up to London, or whither I please; and not
 come near me, but by my own permission; and till I am satisfied in every

 settlements, &c.
 'To conduct me to you, my dear, is another of his proposals, not
 doubting, he says, but your mother will receive me:* or, if that be not
 agreeable to you, or to your mother, or to me, he will put me into Mr.
 Hickman's protection; whom, no doubt he says, you can influence; and
 that it may be given out, that I have gone to Bath, or Bristol, or
 abroad; wherever I please.

 'Again, if it be more agreeable, he proposes to attend me privately to
 London, where he will procure handsome lodgings for me, and both his
 cousins Montague to receive me in them, and to accompany me till
 all shall be adjusted to my mind; and till a reconciliation shall
 be effected; which he assures me nothing shall be wanting in him to
 facilitate, greatly as he has been insulted by all my family.
 'These several measures he proposes to my choice; as it was unlikely,
 he says, that he could procure, in the time, a letter from Lady Betty,
 under her own hand, to invite me in form to her house, unless he
 had been himself to go to that lady for it; which, at this critical
 juncture, while he is attending my commands, is impossible.
