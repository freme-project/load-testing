my dear, or get from them all, and from him too.
 You intend the latter, you'll say, as soon as you have opportunity.
 That, as above hinted, I hope quickly to furnish you with: and then comes
 on a trial between you and yourself.
 These are the very fellows that we women do not naturally hate.  We don't
 always know what is, and what is not, in our power to do.  When some
 principal point we have long had in view becomes so critical, that we
 must of necessity choose or refuse, then perhaps we look about us; are
 affrighted at the wild and uncertain prospect before us; and, after a few
 struggles and heart-aches, reject the untried new; draw in your horns,
 and resolve to snail-on, as we did before, in a track we are acquainted
 with.
 I shall be impatient till I have your next.  I am, my dearest friend,
 Your ever affectionate and faithful
 ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER XXXV
 MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
 WEDNESDAY, MAY 17.
 I cannot conceal from you any thing that relates to yourself so much as
 the enclosed does.  You will see what the noble writer apprehends from
 you, and wishes of you, with regard to Miss Harlowe, and how much at
 heart all your relations have it that you do honourably by her.  They
 compliment me with an influence over you, which I wish with all my soul
 you would let me have in this article.
 Let me once more entreat thee, Lovelace, to reflect, before it be too
 late (before the mortal offence be given) upon the graces and merits of
 this lady.  Let thy frequent remorses at last end in one effectual
 remorse.  Let not pride and wantonness of heart ruin the fairer
 prospects.  By my faith, Lovelace, there is nothing but vanity, conceit,
 and nonsense, in our wild schemes.  As we grow older, we shall be wiser,
