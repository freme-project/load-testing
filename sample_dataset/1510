LETTER LVI
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TUESDAY, APRIL 25.
 Be comforted; be not dejected; do not despond, my dearest and
 best-beloved friend. God Almighty is just and gracious, and gives not
 his assent to rash and inhuman curses. Can you think that Heaven will
 seal to the black passions of its depraved creatures? If it did, malice,

 (and when the sense of your fault, and the weight of a parent's curse
 are so strong upon you,) should be quite broken.
 Lord bless me, how your aunt writes!--Can there be two rights and two
 wrongs in palpable cases!--But, my dear, she must be wrong: so they all
