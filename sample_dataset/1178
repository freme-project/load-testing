 Forbid it, heaven! that Clarissa Harlowe should have it in her thought
 to serve, or even to save herself at the expense of her sincerity, and

 I saw at the time that it was as wrong with respect to answering his own
 view, as it was insolent: For, could he think, as Betty (I suppose from
 her betters) justly observed, that parents would be insulted out of
 their right to dispose of their own child, by a violent man, whom they
