one justly doubt the worthiness of his interior. You, our pattern, so
 lovely in feature, so graceful in person, have none of it; and have
 therefore with the best grace always held, that it is not excusable even
 in a woman.
 You must know, that this subject was warmly debated among us in our last
 conversation: and Miss Lloyd wished me to write to you upon it for your
 opinion; to which, in every debated case, we always paid the greatest
 deference. I hope you will not be so much engrossed by your weighty
 cares, as not to have freedom of spirits enough to enter upon the task.
 You know how much we all admire your opinion on such topics; which ever
 produces something new and instructive, as you handle the subjects. And
 pray tell us, to what you think it owing, that your man seems so careful
 to adorn that self-adorned person of his! yet so manages, that one
 cannot for one's heart think him a coxcomb?--Let this question, and the
 above tasks, divert, and not displease you, my dear. One subject, though
 ever so important, could never yet engross your capacious mind. If
 they should displease you, you must recollect the many instances of my
 impertinence which you have forgiven, and then say, 'This is a mad girl:
 but yet I love her!--And she is my own'
 ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER XXXVIII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY, MARCH 20.
 Your last so sensibly affects me, that I must postpone every other
 consideration, however weighty, to reply to it: and this I will do
 very distinctly, and with all the openness of heart which our mutual
 friendship demands.
 But let me observe, in the first place, gratefully observe, that if I
 have in fifty passages of my letters given you such undoubted proofs of
 my value for Mr. Lovelace, that you have spared me for the sake of my
 explicitness, it is acting by me with a generosity worthy of yourself.
