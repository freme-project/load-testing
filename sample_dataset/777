 LETTER XXI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SAT. NIGHT.
 I have been down. I am to be unlucky in all I do, I think, be my
 intentions ever so good. I have made matters worse instead of better: as
 I shall now tell you.
 I found my mother and sister together in my sister's parlour. My mother,
 I fear, by the glow of her fine face, (and as the browner, sullener glow
 in her sister's confirmed,) had been expressing herself with warmth,
 against her unhappier child: perhaps giving such an account of what had
 passed, as should clear herself, and convince Bella, and, through her,
 my brother and uncles, of the sincere pains she had taken with me.
 I entered like a dejected criminal; and besought the favour of a private
 audience. My mother's return, both looks and words, gave but too much
 reason for my above surmise.
 You have, said she [looking at me with a sternness that never sits well
 on her sweet features] rather a requesting than a conceding countenance,
 Clarissa Harlowe: if I am mistaken, tell me so; and I will withdraw with
 you wherever you will.--Yet whether so, or not, you may say what you
 have to say before your sister.
 My mother, I thought, might have withdrawn with me, as she knows that I
 have not a friend in my sister.
 I come down, Madam, said I, to beg of you to forgive me for any thing
 you may have taken amiss in what passed above respecting your honoured
 self; and that you will be pleased to use your endeavours to soften my
 papa's displeasure against me, on his return.
 Such aggravating looks; such lifting up of hands and eyes; such a
 furrowed forehead, in my sister!
 My mother was angry enough without all that; and asked me to what
 purpose I came down, if I were still so intractable.
