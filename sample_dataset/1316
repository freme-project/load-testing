But here my honest Joseph, who gave me the information, was of admirable
 service to me. I had taught him to make the Harlowes believe, that I was
 as communicative to my servants, as their stupid James was to Joseph:*
 Joseph, as they supposed, by tampering with Will,** got all my secrets,
 and was acquainted with all my motions: and having also undertaken to
 watch all those of his young lady,***** the wise family were secure; and
 so was my beloved; and so was I.

 I once had it in my head (and I hinted it to thee* in a former) in case
 such a step should be necessary, to attempt to carry her off by surprise
 from the wood-house; as it is remote from the dwelling-house. This,
 had I attempted, I should have certainly effected, by the help of the
 confraternity: and it would have been an action worthy of us all.--But
 Joseph's conscience, as he called it, stood in my way; for he thought it
 must have been known to be done by his connivance. I could, I dare say,
 have overcome this scruple, as easily as I did many of the others, had
 I not depended at one time upon her meeting me at midnight or late hour
 [and, if she had, she never would have gone back]; at other times,
 upon the cunning family's doing my work for me, equally against their
 knowledge or their wills.
      * See Vol. I. Letter XXXV.
 For well I knew, that James and Arabella were determined never to leave
 off their foolish trials and provocations, till, by tiring her out, they
 had either made her Solmes's wife, or guilty of some such rashness as
 should throw her for ever out of the favour of both her uncles; though
 they had too much malice in their heads to intend service to me by their
 persecutions of her.
