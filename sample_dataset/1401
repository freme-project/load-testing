He then shewed me part of Miss Montague's more sprightly letter,
 'congratulating him upon the honour he had obtained, of the confidence
 of so admirable a lady.' These are her words. Confidence, my dear!
 Nobody, indeed, as you say, will believe otherwise, were they to be
 told the truth: and you see that Miss Montague (and all his family, I
 suppose) think that the step I have taken an extraordinary one. 'She
 also wishes for his speedy nuptials; and to see her new cousin at M.
 Hall: as do Lord M. she tells him, and her sister; and in general all
 the well-wishers of their family.
 'Whenever this happy day shall be passed, she proposes, she says, to
 attend me, and to make one in my train to M. Hall, if his Lordship shall
 continue as ill of the gout as he is at present. But that, should he get
 better, he will himself attend me, she is sure, and conduct me thither;
 and afterwards quit either of his three seats to us, till we shall be
 settled to our mind.'
 This young lady says nothing in excuse for not meeting me on the road,
 or St. Alban's, as he had made me expect she would: yet mentions her
 having been indisposed. Mr. Lovelace had also told me, that Lord M. was
 ill of the gout; which Miss Montague's letter confirms.
 But why did not the man show me these letters last night? Was he afraid
 of giving me too much pleasure?
 LETTER XXXI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 You may believe, my dear, that these letters put me in good humour with
 him. He saw it in my countenance, and congratulated himself upon it.
 Yet I cannot but repeat my wonder, that I could not have the contents of
 them communicated to me last night.*
      * The reader will see how Miss Howe accounts for this, in Letter XXXV.
 He then urged me to go directly to Lady Betty's, on the strength of her
 letter.
