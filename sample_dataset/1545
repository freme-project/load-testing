me a share in the praise as to person.  But was sorry, she said, that she
 was likely to lose us so soon as Mr. Lovelace talked of.
 I answered her with suitable civility; and she withdrew with great tokens
 of respect.  With greater, I think, than should be from distance of
 years, as she was the wife of a gentleman; and as the appearance of every
 thing about her, as well house as dress, carries the marks of such good
 circumstances, as require not abasement.
 If, my dear, you will write, against prohibition, be pleased to direct,
 To Miss Laetitia Beaumont; to be left till called for, at Mr. Wilson's,
 in Pall Mall.
 Mr. Lovelace proposed this direction to me, not knowing of your desire
 that your letters should pass by a third hand.  As his motive for it was,
 that my brother might not trace out where we are, I am glad, as well from
 this instance as from others, that he seems to think he has done mischief
 enough already.
 Do you know how my poor Hannah does?
 Mr. Lovelace is so full of his contrivances and expedients, that I think
 it may not be amiss to desire you to look carefully to the seals of my
 letters, as I shall to those of yours.  If I find him base in this
 particular, I shall think him capable of any evil; and will fly him as my
 worst enemy.

 direction whither,) goes to town constantly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
