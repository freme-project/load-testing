believed was likely to oblige them to contract their views.
 And how was this to be done, after such a declaration from both my
 uncles?
 My brother found out the way. My sister (as I have said) went hand in
 hand with him. Between them, the family union was broke, and every one
 was made uneasy. Mr. Lovelace was received more and more coldly by all:
 but not being to be put out of his course by slights only, personal
 affronts succeeded; defiances next; then the rencounter: that, as you
 have heard, did the business. And now, if I do not oblige them, my
 grandfather's estate is to be litigated with me; and I, who never
 designed to take advantage of the independency bequeathed me, am to be
 as dependent upon my father's will, as a daughter ought to be who knows
 not what is good for herself. This is the language of the family now.
 But if I will suffer myself to be prevailed upon, how happy (as they lay
 it out) shall we all be!--Such presents am I to have, such jewels, and
 I cannot tell what, from every one in the family! Then Mr. Solmes's
 fortunes are so great, and his proposals so very advantageous, (no
 relation whom he values,) that there will be abundant room to raise
 mine upon them, were the high-intended favours of my own relations to
 be quite out of the question. Moreover, it is now, with this view,
 found out, that I have qualifications which of themselves will be a full
 equivalent to Mr. Solmes for the settlements he is to make; and still
 leave him under an obligation to me for my compliance. He himself thinks
 so, I am told--so very poor a creature is he, even in his own eyes, as
 well as in theirs.
 These desirable views answered, how rich, how splendid shall we all
 three be! And I--what obligations shall I lay upon them all!--And that
 only by doing an act of duty so suitable to my character, and manner of
 thinking; if, indeed, I am the generous as well as dutiful creature I
 have hitherto made them believe I am.
