have no friend, Margaret:  when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of
 success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by
 disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I
 shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor
 medium for the communication of feeling.  I desire the company of a man
 who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may
 deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a
 friend.  I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a

 native country.  Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more
 illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.  It is true that I have
 thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent,
 but they want (as the painters call it) KEEPING; and I greatly need a
 friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and
 affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.  Well, these
 are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide
 ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.  Yet
 some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in
 these rugged bosoms.  My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of
 wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or
 rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in
