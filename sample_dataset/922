break them, I shall not be worth any body's having. And further
 still, unkindly as my brother has used me, I will go down to Scotland
 privately, as his housekeeper [I now see I may be spared here] if he
 will promise to treat me no worse than he would do an hired one.--Or
 I will go to Florence, to my cousin Morden, if his stay in Italy will
 admit of it. In either case, it may be given out, that I am gone to the
 other; or to the world's end. I care not whither it is said I am gone,
 or do go.'
 Let me ask you, child, if you will give your pretty proposal in writing?
 Yes, with all my heart. And I stepped to my closet, and wrote to the
 purpose I have mentioned; and moreover, the following lines to my

 MY DEAR BROTHER,
 I hope I have made such proposals to my sister as will be accepted. I am
 sure they will, if you please to give them your sanction. Let me beg

 nor any consideration, induce me to revoke it. You can do more than any
 body to reconcile my parents and uncles to me. Let me owe this desirable
 favour to your brotherly interposition, and you will for ever oblige
 Your afflicted Sister, CL. HARLOWE.
 And how do you think Bella employed herself while I was writing?--Why,
