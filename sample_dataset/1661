I called him by several very hard names in my last.  I had but just heard
 of some of his vilenesses, when I sat down to write; so my indignation
 was raised.  But on inquiry, and recollection, I find that the facts laid
 to his charge were all of them committed some time ago--not since he has
 had strong hopes of your favour.
 This is saying something for him.  His generous behaviour to the
 innkeeper's daughter is a more recent instance to his credit; to say
 nothing of the universal good character he has as a kind landlord.  And
 then I approve much of the motion he made to put you in possession of
 Mrs. Fretchville's house, while he continues at the other widow's, till
 you agree that one house shall hold you.  I wish this were done.  Be sure
 you embrace this offer, (if you do not soon meet at the altar,) and get
 one of his cousins with you.
 Were you once married, I should think you cannot be very unhappy, though
 you may not be so happy with him as you deserve to be.  The stake he has
 in his country, and his reversions; the care he takes of his affairs; his
 freedom from obligation; nay, his pride, with your merit, must be a
 tolerable security for you, I should think.  Though particulars of his
 wickedness, as they come to my knowledge, hurt and incense me; yet, after
 all, when I give myself time to reflect, all that I have heard of him to
 his disadvantage was comprehended in the general character given of him
 long ago, by Lord M.'s and his own dismissed bailiff,* and which was
 confirmed to me by Mrs. Fortescue, as I heretofore told you,** and to you
 by Mrs. Greme.***

 You can have nothing, therefore, I think, to be deeply concerned about,
 but his future good, and the bad example he may hereafter set to his own
 family.  These indeed are very just concerns: but were you to leave him
