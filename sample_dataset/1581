brings any of them to a conclusion; for if his company have patience to
 hear him out, he breaks in upon himself by so many parenthetical
 intrusions, as one may call them, and has so many incidents springing in
 upon him, that he frequently drops his own thread, and sometimes sits
 down satisfied half way; or, if at other times he would resume it, he
