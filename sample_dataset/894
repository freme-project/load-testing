the subject I was forced so abruptly to quit, and will obey yours, Miss
 Lloyd's, Miss Campion's, and Miss Biddulph's call, with as much temper
 as my divided thought will admit. The dead stillness of this solemn hour
 will, I hope, contribute to calm my disturbed mind.
 In order to acquit myself of so heavy a charge as that of having

 own that I have: and thus called upon by my dearest friend, I will set
 before you both parts of the argument.
 And first, what occurred to me in his favour.
 At his introduction into our family, his negative virtues were insisted
 upon:--He was no gamester; no horse-racer; no fox-hunter; no drinker:
