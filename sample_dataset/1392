in relation to his own child?
 I know, Madam, there is no arguing with you. But, nevertheless, I had
 hoped to have made myself some little merit with you, so as that I might
 not have been the preliminary sacrifice to a reconciliation.
 Your hope, Sir, had been better grounded if you had had my consent to my
 abandoning of my father's house--
 Always, Madam, and for ever, to be reminded of the choice you would have
 made of that damn'd Solmes--rather than--
 Not so hasty! not so rash, Mr. Lovelace! I am convinced that there was
 no intention to marry me to that Solmes on Wednesday.
 So I am told they now give out, in order to justify themselves at your
 expense. Every body living, Madam, is obliged to you for your kind
 thoughts but I.
 Excuse me, good Mr. Lovelace [waving my hand, and bowing], that I am
 willing to think the best of my father.
 Charming creature! said he, with what a bewitching air is that
 said!--And with a vehemence in his manner would have snatched my hand.
 But I withdrew it, being much offended with him.
 I think, Madam, my sufferings for your sake might have entitled me to
 some favour.
 My sufferings, Sir, for your impetuous temper, set against your
 sufferings for my sake, I humbly conceive, leave me very little your
 debtor.
 Lord! Madam, [assuming a drawling air] What have you suffered?--Nothing
 but what you can easily forgive. You have been only made a prisoner in
 your father's house, by way of doing credit to your judgment!--You have
 only had an innocent and faithful servant turned out of your service,
 because you loved her!--You have only had your sister's confident
 servant set over you, with leave to tease and affront you--!
 Very well, Sir!
