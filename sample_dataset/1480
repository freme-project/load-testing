The affair of Miss Betterton was a youthful frolic. I love dearly to
 exercise my invention. I do assure you, Joseph, that I have ever had
 more pleasure in my contrivances, than in the end of them. I am no
 sensual man: but a man of spirit--one woman is like another--you

 I was ever nice in my loves.--These were the rules I laid down to myself
 on my entrance into active life:--To set the mother above want, if her
 friends were cruel, and if I could not get her a husband worthy of her:
 to shun common women--a piece of justice I owed to innocent ladies, as
 well as to myself: to marry off a former mistress, if possible, before
