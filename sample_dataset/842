with my chosen friend, although a person of unexceptionable honour and
 prudence, and of my own sex; my servant to be torn from me, and another
 servant set over me; to be confined, like a prisoner, to narrow and
 disgraceful limits, in order avowedly to mortify me, and to break my

 upon me. My brother pretended once, that it was owing to such value,
 that Mr. Lovelace's address was prohibited.--Can this be; and such a man
 as Mr. Solmes be intended for me?
 As to his proposed settlements, I hope I shall not incur your great
