 twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
 which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
 the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,
 that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
 fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
 face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read
