 This, in short, was the case: while she was refusing all manner of
 obligation to me, keeping me at haughty distance, in hopes that her
 cousin Morden's arrival would soon fix her in a full and absolute

 the fruits of my own benefaction? I was earnest in my vows to marry,
 and my ardour to urge the present time was a real ardour. But extreme
