without giving him hitherto any reason to think he has fastened an
 obligation upon me for it.--Over the other, Who, Madam, has any?--I am
 grieved at heart, to be obliged to lay so great a blame at my brother's
 door, although my reputation and my liberty are both to be sacrificed
 to his resentment and ambition. May not, however, so deep a sufferer be
 permitted to speak out?
 This communication being as voluntarily made, as dutifully intended,
 I humbly presume to hope, that I shall not be required to produce the
 letter itself. I cannot either in honour or prudence do that, because of
 the vehemence of his style; for having heard [not, I assure you, by my

 met with; he thinks himself entitled to place it to his own account, by
 reason of speeches thrown out by some of my relations, equally vehement.
 If I do not answer him, he will be made desperate, and think himself
 justified (thought I shall not think him so) in resenting the treatment
 he complains of: if I do, and if, in compliment to me, he forbears to
 resent what he thinks himself entitled to resent; be pleased, Madam, to
 consider the obligation he will suppose he lays me under.
 If I were as strongly prepossessed in his favour as is supposed, I

 a still further proof that I am not prepossessed, to beg of you to
 consider, Whether, upon the whole, the proposal I made, of declaring for
 the single life (which I will religiously adhere to) is not the best way
 to get rid of his pretensions with honour. To renounce him, and not be
 allowed to aver, that I will never be the other man's, will make him
 conclude (driven as I am driven) that I am determined in that other
 man's favour.
 If this has not its due weight, my brother's strange schemes must be
 tried, and I will resign myself to my destiny with all the acquiescence
 that shall be granted to my prayers. And so leaving the whole to your
