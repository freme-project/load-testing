fellow--evidently when too late for pursuit. They got together, and when
 a posse, ran to the place of interview; and some of them as far as to
 the tracks of the chariot wheels, without stopping. And having heard the
 man's tale upon the spot, a general lamentation, a mutual upbraiding,
 and rage, and grief, were echoed from the different persons, according
 to their different tempers and conceptions. And they returned like fools
 as they went.
 Your brother, at first, ordered horses and armed men to be got ready for
 a pursuit. Solmes and your uncle Tony were to be of the party. But your
 mother and your aunt Hervey dissuaded them from it, for fear of adding
 evil to evil; not doubting but Lovelace had taken measures to support
 himself in what he had done; and especially when the servant declared,
 that he saw you run with him as fast as you could set foot to the
 ground; and that there were several armed men on horseback at a small
 distance off.

 My mother's absence was owing to her suspicion, that the Knolly's were
 to assist in our correspondence. She made them a visit upon it. She does
 every thing at once. And they have promised, that no more letters shall
 be left there, without her knowledge.
 But Mr. Hickman has engaged one Filmer, a husbandman in the lane we call
 Finch-lane, near us, to receive them. Thither you will be pleased to
 direct yours, under cover, to Mr. John Soberton; and Mr. Hickman himself
 will call for them there; and there shall leave mine. It goes against me
 too, to make him so useful to me. He looks already so proud upon it!
 I shall have him [Who knows?] give himself airs--He had best consider,
 that the favour he has been long aiming at, may put him into a
 very dangerous, a very ticklish situation. He that can oblige, may
 disoblige--Happy for some people not to have it in their power to
 offend!
