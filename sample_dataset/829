with rival indignation: many a cheek glow; and even many a fan have I
 caused to be snapped at a sister-beauty; accompanied with a reflection
 perhaps at being seen alone with a wild young fellow who could not be in
 private with both at once.
 In short, Jack, it was more pride than love, as I now find it, that put
 me upon making such a confounded rout about losing that noble varletess.
 I thought she loved me at least as well as I believed I loved her:
 nay, I had the vanity to suppose she could not help it. My friends were
 pleased with my choice. They wanted me to be shackled: for early did
 they doubt my morals, as to the sex. They saw, that the dancing, the
 singing, the musical ladies were all fond of my company: For who [I am
 in a humour to be vain, I think!]--for who danced, who sung, who touched
 the string, whatever the instrument, with a better grace than thy
 friend?
 I have no notion of playing the hypocrite so egregiously, as to pretend
 to be blind to qualifications which every one sees and acknowledges.
 Such praise-begetting hypocrisy! Such affectedly disclaimed attributes!
 Such contemptible praise-traps!--But yet, shall my vanity extend only
 to personals, such as the gracefulness of dress, my debonnaire, and my
 assurance?--Self-taught, self-acquired, these!--For my parts, I value
 not myself upon them. Thou wilt say, I have no cause.--Perhaps not. But
 if I had any thing valuable as to intellectuals, those are not my own;
 and to be proud of what a man is answerable for the abuse of, and has
 no merit in the right use of, is to strut, like the jay, in borrowed
 plumage.
 But to return to my fair jilt. I could not bear, that a woman, who was
 the first that had bound me in silken fetters [they were not iron ones,
 like those I now wear] should prefer a coronet to me: and when the bird
 was flown, I set more value upon it, that when I had it safe in my cage,
 and could visit in when I pleased.
