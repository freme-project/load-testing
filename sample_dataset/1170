that soft word.
 Who was the old Greek, that said, he governed Athens; his wife, him; and
 his son, her?
 It was not my mother's fault [I am writing to you, you know] that she
 did not govern my father. But I am but a daughter!--Yet I thought I was
 not quite so powerless when I was set upon carrying a point, as I find
 myself to be.
 Adieu, my dear!--Happier times must come--and that quickly too.--The
 strings cannot long continue to be thus overstrained. They must break
 or be relaxed. In either way, the certainty must be preferable to the
 suspense.
 One word more:
 I think in my conscience you must take one of these two alternatives;
 either to consent to let us go to London together privately; [in which
 case, I will procure a vehicle, and meet you at your appointment at the
 stile to which Lovelace proposes to bring his uncle's chariot;] or,
 to put yourself into the protection of Lord M. and the ladies of his
 family.
 You have another, indeed; and that is, if you are absolutely resolved
 against Solmes, to meet and marry Lovelace directly.
 Whichsoever of these you make choice of, you will have this plea,
 both to yourself, and to the world, that you are concluded by the same
 uniform principle that has governed your whole conduct, ever since the
 contention between Lovelace and your brother has been on foot: that
 is to say, that you have chosen a lesser evil, in hopes to prevent a
 greater.
 Adieu! and Heaven direct for the best my beloved creature, prays
 Her ANNA HOWE.
