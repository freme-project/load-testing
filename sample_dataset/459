every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
 go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
 Eyford."
 Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
 together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
 There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
 Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
 Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
 seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
 for its centre.
 "There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of
 ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere
 near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
 "It was an hour's good drive."
 "And you think that they brought you back all that way when you
 were unconscious?"
 "They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having
 been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
 "What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have
 spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.
 Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
 "I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face
 in my life."
 "Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I
 have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon
 it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
 "I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
 "Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your
 opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is
 south, for the country is more deserted there."
