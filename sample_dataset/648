deserved motto; though now, to your regret, pushed into blaze, as I may
 say: and yet blamed at home for the faults of others--how must such a
 virtue suffer on every hand!--yet it must be allowed, that your present
 trial is but proportioned to your prudence.
 As all your friends without doors are apprehensive that some other
 unhappy event may result from so violent a contention, in which it seems

 resentments of a man of Mr. Lovelace's spirit; who, as he gives out, has
 been treated with high indignity by your uncles. My mother will have

 a man who is to wade into her favour (this was his expression) through
 the blood of her brother.
 Write to me therefore, my dear, the whole of your story from the
 time that Mr. Lovelace was first introduced into your family; and
 particularly an account of all that passed between him and your sister;
 about which there are different reports; some people scrupling not to
 insinuate that the younger sister has stolen a lover from the elder: and
 pray write in so full a manner as may satisfy those who know not so much
 of your affairs as I do. If anything unhappy should fall out from the
 violence of such spirits as you have to deal with, your account of all
 things previous to it will be your best justification.
 You see what you draw upon yourself by excelling all your sex. Every
 individual of it who knows you, or has heard of you, seems to think
