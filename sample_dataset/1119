courage in one's self--I see that plainly now--yet perhaps, at bottom,
 the new-made bravo is a greater coward than the other.
 I turned from him, and seated myself in one of the fireside chairs,
 fanning myself. I have since recollected, that I must have looked
 very saucily. Could I have had any thoughts of the man, I should have
 despised myself for it. But what can be said in the case of an aversion
 so perfectly sincere?
 He hemmed five or six times, as I had done above; and these produced a
 sentence--that I could not but see his confusion. This sentence produced
 two or three more. I believe my aunt had been his tutoress; for it was
 his awe, his reverence for so superlative a Lady [I assure you!] And he
 hoped--he hoped--three times he hoped, before he told me what--at
 last it came out, that I was too generous (generosity, he said, was my
 character) to despise him for such--for such--for such--true tokens of
 his love.
 I do indeed see you under some confusion, Sir; and this gives me hope,
 that although I have been compelled, as I may call it, to give way
 to this interview, it may be attended with happier effects than I had
 apprehended from it.
 He had hemmed himself into more courage.
 You could not, Madam, imagine any creature so blind to your merits,
 and so little attracted by them, as easily to forego the interest and
 approbation he was honoured with by your worthy family, while he had
 any hope given him, that one day he might, by his perseverance and zeal,
 expect your favour.
 I am but too much aware, Sir, that it is upon the interest and
 approbation you mention, that you build such hope. It is impossible
 otherwise, that a man, who has any regard for his own happiness, would
 persevere against such declarations as I have made, and think myself
 obliged to make, in justice to you, as well as to myself.
