not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
 possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of
 these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his
 analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without
 an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and
 have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
 surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
 him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable
 in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted
 to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
 points in connection with it which never have been, and probably
 never will be, entirely cleared up.
 The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
 or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my
 headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the
 adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant

 British barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the
 Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the
 Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,
 Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to

 them present such singular features as the strange train of
 circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
 It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales
 had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had
