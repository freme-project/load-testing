reverence, my adoration, I may call it, of your virtues?  All is owing to
 misapprehension, I hope, on both sides.  Condescend to clear up but your
 part, as I will mine, and all must speedily be happy.--Would to Heaven I
 loved that Heaven as I love you! and yet, if I doubted a return in love,

 that I am free of all obligation to you.  You know, I never made you
 promises.  You know, that you are not under any to me.--My broken
 fortunes I matter not--
 She was proceeding--My dearest life, said I, I have been all this time,
