perhaps they would hold me unworthy of their alliance, if they were to
 think my flight a voluntary one. O my dear, how uneasy to us are our
 reflections upon every doubtful occurrence, when we know we have been
 prevailed upon to do a wrong thing!
 SUNDAY MORNING.
 Ah! this man, my dear! We have had warmer dialogues than ever yet we
 have had. At fair argument, I find I need not fear him;* but he is such
 a wild, such an ungovernable creature [he reformed!] that I am half
 afraid of him.
      * See this confirmed by Mr. Lovelace, Letter XI. of this volume.
 He again, on my declaring myself uneasy at his stay with me here,
 proposed that I would put myself into Lady Betty's protection; assuring
 me that he thought he could not leave me at Mrs. Sorlings's with safety
 to myself. And upon my declining to do that, for the reasons I gave you
 in my last,* he urged me to make a demand of my estate.
      * See Letter XXVIII. of this volume.
 He knew it, I told him, to be my resolution not to litigate with my
 father.
 Nor would he put me upon it, he replied, but as the last thing. But
 if my spirit would not permit me to be obliged, as I called it, to any
 body, and yet if my relations would refuse me my own, he knew not how
 I could keep up that spirit, without being put to inconveniences,
 which would give him infinite concern--Unless--unless--unless, he said,
 hesitating, as if afraid to speak out--unless I would take the only
 method I could take, to obtain the possession of my own.
 What is that, Sir?
 Sure the man saw by my looks, when he came with his creeping unless's,
 that I guessed what he meant.
 Ah! Madam, can you be at a loss to know what that method is?--They will
 not dispute with a man that right which they contest with you.
