Hear it read, said my uncle. You are so ready to take part with--
 With any body, Sir, that is accused anonymously, and from interested
 motives.
 He began to read; and there seemed to be a heavy load of charges in this
 letter against the poor criminal: but I stopped the reading of it,
 and said, It will not be my fault, if this vilified man be not as
 indifferent to me, as one whom I never saw. If he be otherwise at
 present, which I neither own, nor deny, it proceed from the strange
 methods taken to prevent it. Do not let one cause unite him and me, and

 But to what purpose, Sir! said I--Had not Mr. Solmes a view in this?
 And, besides, can any thing worse be said of Mr. Lovelace, than I have

 But this, said my uncle, and what Mr. Solmes can tell you besides,
 amounts to the fullest proof--
 Was the unhappy man, then, so freely treated in his character before,

 may presume to say so in this case, to any body but himself.
 I see very plainly, girl, said my uncle, your prepossession, your fond
 prepossession, for the person of a man without morals.
 Indeed, my dear, said my aunt, you too much justify all your
 apprehension. Surprising! that a young creature of virtue and honour
 should thus esteem a man of a quite opposite character!
 Dear Madam, do not conclude against me too hastily. I believe Mr.
 Lovelace is far from being so good as he ought to be: but if every man's
 private life was searched into by prejudiced people, set on for that
