"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
 "I am sure."
 "And why?"
 "Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
 betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
 "Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That
 is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to
 look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in
 London for the present?"
 "Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the
 Count Von Kramm."
 "Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
 "Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
 "Then, as to money?"
 "You have carte blanche."
 "Absolutely?"
 "I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
 to have that photograph."
 "And for present expenses?"
 The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
 and laid it on the table.
 "There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
 notes," he said.
 Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
 handed it to him.
 "And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
 "Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
 Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
 photograph a cabinet?"
 "It was."
