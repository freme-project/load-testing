I have taken this truly-reluctant step, inconsistent with any reasonable
 engagement I shall enter into, if I am not further precipitated. Let me
 not have it to say, now at this important crisis! that I have a sister,
 but not a friend in that sister. My reputation, dearer to me than life,
 (whatever you may imagine from the step I have taken,) is suffering. A
 little lenity will, even yet, in a great measure, restore it, and make
 that pass for a temporary misunderstanding only, which otherwise will be
 a stain as durable as life, upon a creature who has already been treated
 with great unkindness, to use no harsher a word.
 For your own sake therefore, for my brother's sake, by whom (I must say)
 I have been thus precipitated, and for all the family's sake, aggravate
 not my fault, if, on recollecting every thing, you think it one; nor by
 widening the unhappy difference, expose a sister for ever--prays
 Your affectionate CL. HARLOWE.
 I shall take it for a very great favour to have my clothes directly sent
 me, together with fifty guineas, which you will find in my escritoire
 (of which I enclose the key); as also of the divinity and miscellany
 classes of my little library; and, if it be thought fit, my
 jewels--directed for me, to be left till called for, at Mr. Osgood's,
 near Soho-square.
 LETTER XI
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
      Mr. Lovelace, in continuation of his last letter, (No. VII.)
      gives an account to his friend (pretty much to the same
      effect with the lady's) of all that passed between them at
      the inns, in the journey, and till their fixing at Mrs.
      Sorling's; to avoid repetition, those passages in his
      narrative are extracted, which will serve to embellish
      her's; to open his views; or to display the humourous talent
      he was noted for.
