a concert, and she may have the misfortune to lose her pockets.
 But how shall I find this out; since her Dorcas knows no more of her
 dressing and undressing than her Lovelace?  For she is dressed for the
 day before she appears even to her servant. Vilely suspicious!  Upon my
 soul, Jack, a suspicious temper is a punishable temper.  If a woman
 suspects a rogue in an honest man, is it not enough to make the honest
 man who knows it a rogue?
 But, as to her pockets, I think my mind hankers after them, as the less
 mischievous attempt.  But they cannot hold all the letters I should wish

    he may have a pretence to detain her.]
 He then proceeds as follows:
 I have ordered Dorcas to cultivate by all means her lady's favour; to
 lament her incapacity as to writing and reading; to shew letters to her
 lady, as from pretended country relations; to beg her advice how to
 answer them, and to get them answered; and to be always aiming at
 scrawling with a pen, lest inky fingers should give suspicion.  I have
 moreover given the wench an ivory-leafed pocket-book, with a silver
 pencil, that she may make memoranda on occasion.
