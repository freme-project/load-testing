every thing laudable, and even for the more envied graces of person and
 dress, and an all-surpassing elegance in both, where you were known, and
 those subjects talked of.
 The poor blessed you every step you trod: the rich thought you their
 honour, and took a pride that they were not obliged to descend from their
 own class for an example that did credit to it.
 Though all men wished for you, and sought you, young as you were; yet,
 had not those who were brought to address you been encouraged out of
 sordid and spiteful views, not one of them would have dared to lift up
 his eyes to you.
 Thus happy in all about you, thus making happy all within your circle,
 could you think that nothing would happen to you, to convince you that
 you were not to be exempted from the common lot?--To convinced you, that
 you were not absolutely perfect; and that you must not expect to pass
 through life without trial, temptation, and misfortune?
 Indeed, it must be owned that no trial, no temptation, worthy of your
 virtue, and of your prudence, could well have attacked you sooner,
 because of your tender years, and more effectually, than those heavy ones
 under which you struggle; since it must be allowed, that you equanimity
 and foresight made you superior to common accidents; for are not most of
 the troubles that fall to the lot of common mortals brought upon
 themselves either by their too large desires, or too little deserts?--
 Cases, both, from which you stood exempt.--It was therefore to be some
 man, or some worse spirit in the shape of one, that, formed on purpose,
 was to be sent to invade you; while as many other such spirits as there
 are persons in your family were permitted to take possession, severally,
 in one dark hour, of the heart of every one of it, there to sit perching,
 perhaps, and directing every motion to the motions of the seducer
 without, in order to irritate, to provoke, to push you forward to meet
 him.
