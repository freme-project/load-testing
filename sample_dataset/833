relations have set on foot in mere malice to me!--Thou wilt say I rave.
 And so I do:
  Perdition catch my soul, but I do love her.
 Else, could I hear the perpetual revilings of her implacable
 family?--Else, could I basely creep about--not her proud father's
 house--but his paddock and garden walls?--Yet (a quarter of a mile
 distance between us) not hoping to behold the least glimpse of her
 shadow?--Else, should I think myself repaid, amply repaid, if the
 fourth, fifth, or sixth midnight stroll, through unfrequented paths, and
 over briery enclosures, affords me a few cold lines; the even expected
 purport only to let me know, that she values the most worthless person
 of her very worthless family, more than she values me; and that she
 would not write at all, but to induce me to bear insults, which unman
 me to bear?--My lodging in the intermediate way at a wretched alehouse;
 disguised like an inmate of it: accommodations equally vile, as those
 I met with in my Westphalian journey. 'Tis well, that the necessity for
 all this arise not from scorn and tyranny! but is first imposed upon
 herself!
 But was ever hero in romance (fighting with giants and dragons excepted)
 called upon to harder trials?--Fortune and family, and reversionary
 grandeur on my side! Such a wretched fellow my competitor!--Must I not
 be deplorably in love, that can go through these difficulties, encounter
 these contempts?--By my soul, I am half ashamed of myself: I, who am
 perjured too, by priority of obligation, if I am faithful to any woman
 in the world?
 And yet, why say I, I am half ashamed?--Is it not a glory to love her
 whom every one who sees her either loves, or reveres, or both? Dryden
 says,
  The cause of love can never be assign'd:
  'Tis in no face;--but in the lover's mind.
