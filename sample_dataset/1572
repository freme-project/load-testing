mentioned above, by my behaviour.
 The subject of the discourse was particular enough: It was about a
 prophet's story or parable of an ewe-lamb taken by a rich man from a poor
 one, who dearly loved it, and whose only comfort it was: designed to
 strike remorse into David, on his adultery with Uriah's wife Bathsheba,
 and his murder of the husband.  These women, Jack, have been the occasion
 of all manner of mischief from the beginning!  Now, when David, full of
 indignation, swore [King David would swear, Jack: But how shouldst thou
 know who King David was?--The story is in the Bible,] that the rich man
 should surely die; Nathan, which was the prophet's name, and a good
 ingenious fellow, cried out, (which were the words of the text,) Thou art
 the man!  By my soul I thought the parson looked directly at me; and at
 that moment I cast my eye full on my ewe-lamb.--But I must tell thee too,
 that, that I thought a good deal of my Rosebud.--A better man than King
 David, in that point, however, thought I!
 When we came home we talked upon the subject; and I showed my charmer my
 attention to the discourse, by letting her know where the Doctor made the
 most of his subject, and where it might have been touched to greater
 advantage: for it is really a very affecting story, and has as pretty a
 contrivance in it as ever I read.  And this I did in such a grave way,
 that she seemed more and more pleased with me; and I have no doubt, that
 I shall get her to favour me to-morrow night with her company at my
 collation.
 SUNDAY EVENING.
 We all dined together in Mrs. Sinclair's parlour:--All excessively right!
 The two nieces have topped their parts--Mrs. Sinclair her's.  Never was
 so easy as now!--'She really thought a little oddly of these people at
 first, she said!  Mrs. Sinclair seemed very forbidding!  Her nieces were
 persons with whom she could not wish to be acquainted.  But really we
 should not be too hasty in our censures.  Some people improve upon us.
