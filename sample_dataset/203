minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.  They know our
 infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
 are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
 certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.  A sister or a
 brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
 suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
 however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
 contemplated with suspicion.  But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
 through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
 I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of
 Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
 feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.  If I
 were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
 utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.  But
 such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
 gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die."

 My beloved Sister,
 I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
 doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit
 it.  I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
 threaten every moment to crush my vessel.  The brave fellows whom I
 have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have
 none to bestow.  There is something terribly appalling in our
 situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.  Yet it is
 terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
 through me.  If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.
 And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?  You will not hear
 of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.  Years will
 pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by
