from my friends; I had not been either confined or ill treated: nor
 would my brother's low-meant violence have had a foundation to work
 upon.
 I am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you
 imagine had I staid. My father loved me in his heart: he would not see
 me before; and I wanted only to see him, and to be heard; and a delay
 of his sentence was the least thing I expected from the trial I was to
 stand.
 You are boasting of your merits, Sir: let merit be your boast; nothing
 else can attract me. If personal considerations had principal weight
 with me, either in Solmes's disfavour, or in your favour, I shall
 despise myself: if you value yourself upon them, in preference to the
 person of the poor Solmes, I shall despise you!
 You may glory in your fancied merits in getting me away: but the cause
 of your glory, I tell you plainly, is my shame.
 Make to yourself a title to my regard, which I can better approve of; or
 else you will not have so much merit with me, as you have with yourself.
 But here, Sir, like the first pair, (I, at least, driven out of my
 paradise,) are we recriminating. No more shall you need to tell me of
 your sufferings, and your merits! your all hours, and all weathers! For
 I will bear them in memory as long as I live; and if it be impossible
 for me to reward them, be ever ready to own the obligation. All that
 I desire of you now is, to leave it to myself to seek for some private
 abode: to take the chariot with you to London, or elsewhere: and, if
 I have any further occasion for your assistance and protection, I will
 signify it to you, and be still further obliged to you.
 You are warm, my dearest life!--But indeed there is no occasion for it.
 Had I any views unworthy of my faithful love for you, I should not have
 been so honest in my declarations.
 Then he began again to vow the sincerity of his intentions--
