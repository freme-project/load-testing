Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
 in so strange a vehicle.
 His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
 he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."
 "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"
 "Yes."
 "Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we

 Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
 present day.  The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
