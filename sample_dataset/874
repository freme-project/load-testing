consenting to his address, if he had only a mere relative merit to those
 ladies: since, in that case, the very reasons that made me admire them,
 would have been so many objections to their kinsman.
 I then assured him, that it was with infinite concern, that I had found
 myself drawn into an epistolary correspondence with him; especially
 since that correspondence had been prohibited: and the only agreeable
 use I could think of making of this unexpected and undesired interview,
 was, to let him know, that I should from henceforth think myself obliged
