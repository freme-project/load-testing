at my alighting.  They seemed to be genteel young women.  But more of
 their aunt and them, as I shall see more.
 Miss Sorlings has an uncle at Barnet, whom she found so very ill, that
 her uneasiness, on that account, (having large expectations from him,)
 made me comply with her desire to stay with him.  Yet I wished, as her
