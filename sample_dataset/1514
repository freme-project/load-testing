days with the chaise, in its way to my Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat.
 I received my sister's dreadful letter on Sunday, when Mr. Lovelace was
 out. He saw, on his return, my extreme anguish and dejection; and he was
 told how much worse I had been: for I had fainted away more than once.
 I think the contents of it have touched my head as well as my heart.
 He would fain have seen it. But I would not permit that, because of the

 to such protection as I could find.
 All my comfort is, that your advice repeatedly given me to the same
 purpose, in your kind letter before me, warrants me. I now set out the
