If any thing happen to delay your nuptials, I would advise you to remove:
 but, if you marry, perhaps you may think it no great matter to stay where
 you are till you take possession of your own estate.  The knot once tied,
 and with so resolute a man, it is my opinion your relations will soon
 resign what they cannot legally hold: and, were even a litigation to
 follow, you will not be able, nor ought you to be willing, to help it:
 for your estate will then be his right; and it will be unjust to wish it
 to be withheld from him.
 One thing I would advise you to think of; and that is, of proper
 settlements: it will be to the credit of your prudence and of his justice
 (and the more as matters stand) that something of this should be done
 before you marry.  Bad as he is, nobody accounts him a sordid man.  And I
 wonder he has been hitherto silent on that subject.
 I am not displeased with his proposal about the widow lady's house.  I
 think it will do very well.  But if it must be three weeks before you can
 be certain about it, surely you need not put off his day for that space:
 and he may bespeak his equipages.  Surprising to me, as well as to you,
 that he could be so acquiescent!
 I repeat--continue to write to me.  I insist upon it; and that as
 minutely as possible: or, take the consequence.  I send this by a
 particular hand.  I am, and ever will be,
 Your most affectionate,
 ANNA HOWE.

 other fear, to take up my pen, to beg of you that you will not think of
 being guilty of such an act of love as I can never thank you for; but
 must for ever regret.  If I must continue to write to you, I must.  I
