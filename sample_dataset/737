affections engaged to this man?
 I knew not what the inference would be, if I said they were not.
 You hesitate--You answer me not--You cannot answer me.--Rising--Never
 more will I look upon you with an eye of favour--
 O Madam, Madam! Kill me not with your displeasure--I would not, I need
 not, hesitate one moment, did I not dread the inference, if I answer
 you as you wish.--Yet be that inference what it will, your threatened
 displeasure will make me speak. And I declare to you, that I know not my
 own heart, if it not be absolutely free. And pray, let me ask my dearest
 Mamma, in what has my conduct been faulty, that, like a giddy creature,
 I must be forced to marry, to save me from--From what? Let me beseech
 you, Madam, to be the guardian of my reputation! Let not your Clarissa
 be precipitated into a state she wishes not to enter into with any man!
 And this upon a supposition that otherwise she shall marry herself, and
 disgrace her whole family.
 Well then, Clary [passing over the force of my plea] if your heart be
 free--
 O my beloved Mamma, let the usual generosity of your dear heart operate
 in my favour. Urge not upon me the inference that made me hesitate.
 I won't be interrupted, Clary--You have seen in my behaviour to you,
 on this occasion, a truly maternal tenderness; you have observed that
 I have undertaken the task with some reluctance, because the man is not
 every thing; and because I know you carry your notions of perfection in
 a man too high--
 Dearest Madam, this one time excuse me!--Is there then any danger that I
 should be guilty of an imprudent thing for the man's sake you hint at?
 Again interrupted!--Am I to be questioned, and argued with? You know
 this won't do somewhere else. You know it won't. What reason then,
 ungenerous girl, can you have for arguing with me thus, but because you
 think from my indulgence to you, you may?
