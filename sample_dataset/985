whom, and to what it is owing; and that this part of that character was
 not dispensed with, till it subjected me to that scorn, and to those
 insults, which a brother, who has been so tenacious of an independence
 voluntarily given up by me, and who has appeared so exalted upon it,
 ought not to have shewn to any body, much less to a weak and defenceless
 sister; who is, notwithstanding, an affectionate and respectful one, and
 would be glad to shew herself to be so upon all future occasions; as she
 has in every action of her past life, although of late she has met with
 such unkind returns.

 See, my dear, the force, and volubility, as I may say, of passion; for
 the letter I send you is my first draught, struck off without a blot or
 erasure.

 FRIDAY, THREE O'CLOCK
 As soon as I had transcribed it, I sent it down to my brother by Mrs.
 Betty.
 The wench came up soon after, all aghast, with a Laud, Miss! What have
 you done?--What have you written? For you have set them all in a joyful
 uproar!
 *****
 My sister is but this moment gone from me. She came up all in a flame;
 which obliged me abruptly to lay down my pen: she ran to me--
 O Spirit! said she; tapping my neck a little too hard. And is it come to
 this at last--!
 Do you beat me, Bella?
 Do you call this beating you? only tapping you shoulder thus, said
 she; tapping again more gently--This is what we expected it would come
 to--You want to be independent--My father has lived too long for you--!
