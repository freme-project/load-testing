be proper. But you may prevent all, by one word: and I wish you would,
 Miss. All then would be easy and happy. And, if I may speak my mind, I
 see not why one man is not as good as another: why, especially, a sober
 man is not as good as a rake.
 Well, Betty, said I, sighing, all thy impertinence goes for nothing. But
 I see I am destined to be a very unhappy creature. Yet I will venture
 upon one request more to them.
 And so, quite sick of the pert creature and of myself, I retired to my
 closet, and wrote a few lines to my uncle Harlowe, notwithstanding his
 prohibition; in order to get a reprieve from being carried away so soon
 as Thursday next, if I must go. And this, that I might, if complied
 with, suspend the appointment I have made with Mr. Lovelace; for my
 heart misgives me as to meeting him; and that more and more; I know not
 why. Under the superscription of the letter, I wrote these words: 'Pray,
 dear Sir, be pleased to give this a reading.'
 This is a copy of what I wrote:
 TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
 HONOURED SIR,
 Let me this once be heard with patience, and have my petition granted.
 It is only, that I may not be hurried away so soon as next Thursday.
 Why should the poor girl be turned out of doors so suddenly, so
 disgracefully? Procure for me, Sir, one fortnight's respite. In that
 space of time, I hope you will all relent. My mamma shall not need to
 shut her door in apprehension of seeing her disgraceful child. I will
 not presume to think of entering her presence, or my papa's without
 leave. One fortnight's respite is but a small favour for them to grant,
 except I am to be refused every thing I ask; but it is of the highest
 import to my peace of mind. Procure it for me, therefore, dearest Sir;
 and you will exceedingly oblige
 Your dutiful, though greatly afflicted niece, CL. HARLOWE.
