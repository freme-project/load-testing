Daughter.   I am now disposed to attend to every thing my mamma is
 disposed to say to me.
 M.   Why then, child--why then, my dear--[and the good lady's face looked
 so plump, so smooth, and so shining!]--I see you are all attention,
 Nancy!--But don't be surprised!--don't be uneasy!--But I have--I have--
 Where is it?--[and yet it lay next her heart, never another near it--so
 no difficulty to have found it]--I have a letter, my dear!--[And out from
 her bosom it came: but she still held it in her hand]--I have a letter,
 child.--It is--it is--it is from--from a gentleman, I assure you!--
 [lifting up her head, and smiling.]
 There is no delight to a daughter, thought I, in such surprises as seem
 to be collecting.  I will deprive my mother of the satisfaction of making
 a gradual discovery.
 D.   From Mr. Antony Harlowe, I suppose, Madam?
 M.   [Lips drawn closer: eye raised]  Why, my dear!--I cannot but own--
 But how, I wonder, could you think of Mr. Anthony Harlowe?
 D.   How, Madam, could I think of any body else?
 M.   How could you think of any body else?--[angry, and drawing back her
 face].  But do you know the subject, Nancy?
 D.   You have told it, Madam, by your manner of breaking it to me.  But,
 indeed, I question not that he had two motives in his visits--both
 equally agreeable to me; for all that family love me dearly.
 M.   No love lost, if so, between you and them.  But this [rising] is
 what I get--so like your papa!--I never could open my heart to him!
 D.   Dear Madam, excuse me.  Be so good as to open your heart to me.--
 I don't love the Harlowes--but pray excuse me.
 M.   You have put me quite out with your forward temper! [angrily sitting
 down again.]
 D.   I will be all patience and attention.  May I be allowed to read his
 letter?
