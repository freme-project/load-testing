by your own confession, so much to repent of; and as the scar, indeed,
 you shewed me, will, in one instance, remind you to your dying day.
 The lines, my dear, are from the poet's Ulysses; you have heard me often
 admire them; and I repeated them to him:
       Habitual evils change not on a sudden:
       But many days must pass, and many sorrows;
       Conscious remorse and anguish must be felt,
       To curb desire, to break the stubborn will,
       And work a second nature in the soul,
       Ere Virtue can resume the place she lost:
       'Tis else dissimulation--
 He had often read these lines, he said; but never tasted them
 before.--By his soul, (the unmortified creature swore,) and as he hoped
 to be saved, he was now in earnest in his good resolutions. He had said,
 before I repeated those lines from Rowe, that habitual evils could
 not be changed on a sudden: but he hoped he should not be thought a
 dissembler, if he were not enabled to hold his good purposes; since
 ingratitude and dissimulation were vices that of all others he abhorred.
 May you ever abhor them, said I. They are the most odious of all vices.
 I hope, my dear Miss Howe, I shall not have occasion, in my future
 letters, to contradict these promising appearances. Should I have
 nothing on his side to combat with, I shall be very far from being
 happy, from the sense of my fault, and the indignation of all my
 relations. So shall not fail of condign punishment for it, from my
 inward remorse on account of my forfeited character. But the least ray
 of hope could not dart in upon me, without my being willing to lay hold
 of the very first opportunity to communicate it to you, who take so
 generous a share in all my concerns.
 Nevertheless, you may depend upon it, my dear, that these agreeable
 assurances, and hopes of his begun reformation, shall not make me forget
