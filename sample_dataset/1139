who rubbed his cheek; and shaking her head, Good, dear creature, said
 she, be calm. Let me ask you, If something would have been done, had you
 been more gently used, than you seem to think you have been?
 No, Madam, I cannot say it would, in this gentleman's favour. You
 know, Madam, you know, Sir, to my uncle, I ever valued myself upon my
 sincerity: and once indeed had the happiness to be valued for it.
 My uncle took Mr. Solmes aside. I heard him say, whispering, She must,
 she shall, still be yours.--We'll see, who'll conquer, parents or child,
 uncles or niece. I doubt not to be witness to all this being got over,
 and many a good-humoured jest made of this high phrensy!
 I was heartily vexed.
 Though we cannot find out, continued he, yet we guess, who puts her upon
 this obstinate behaviour. It is not natural to her, man. Nor would I
 concern myself so much about her, but that I know what I say to be true,
 and intend to do great things for her.
 I will hourly pray for that happy time, whispered as audibly Mr. Solmes.
 I never will revive the remembrance of what is now so painful to me.
 Well, but, Niece, I am to tell you, said my aunt, that the sending up
 of the keys, without making any conditions, has wrought for you what
 nothing else could have done. That, and the not finding any thing that
 could give them umbrage, together with Mr. Solmes's interposition--
 O Madam, let me not owe an obligation to Mr. Solmes. I cannot repay it,
 except by my thanks; and those only on condition that he will decline
 his suit. To my thanks, Sir, [turning to him,] if you have a heart
 capable of humanity, if you have any esteem for me for my own sake, I
 beseech you to entitle yourself!--I beseech you, do--!
 O Madam, cried he, believe, believe, believe me, it is impossible. While
 you are single, I will hope. While that hope is encouraged by so many
 worthy friends, I must persevere. I must not slight them, Madam, because
 you slight me.
