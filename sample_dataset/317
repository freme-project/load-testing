and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we
 were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
 great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced
 his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
 his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
 remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,
 gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
 examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
 the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
 the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then
 he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
 highroad, where all traces were lost.
 "It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,
 returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on
 the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
 word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done
 that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,
 and I shall be with you presently."
 It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
 back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
 had picked up in the wood.
 "This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
 "The murder was done with it."
 "I see no marks."
 "There are none."
 "How do you know, then?"
 "The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few
 days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It
 corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other
 weapon."
