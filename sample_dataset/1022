morals in a man whose sought-for relationship to them, by a marriage
 in their family, they have certainly a right either to allow of, or to

 Another line or two, before I am engrossed by my own concerns--upon your
 treatment of Mr. Hickman. Is it, do you think, generous to revenge upon
 an innocent person, the displeasure you receive from another quarter,
 where, I doubt, you are a trespasser too?--But one thing I could tell
 him; and you have best not provoke me to it: It is this, That no woman
 uses ill the man she does not absolutely reject, but she has it in her
 heart to make him amends, when her tyranny has had its run, and he
 has completed the measure of his services and patience. My mind is not
 enough at ease to push this matter further.
 I will now give you the occasion of my present apprehensions.
 I had reason to fear, as I mentioned in mine of this morning, that a
 storm was brewing. Mr. Solmes came home from church this afternoon with
 my brother. Soon after, Betty brought me up a letter, without saying
 from whom. It was in a cover, and directed by a hand I never saw before;
 as if it were supposed that I would not receive and open it, had I known
 from whom it came.
 These are the contents:

 and the honour of all youre familly. It relates to the designes of one
 whom you are sed to valew more than he desarves; and to some of his
 reprobat actions; which I am reddie to give you convincing proofes of
