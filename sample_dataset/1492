in making you fly your father's house, and that he has nothing to fear
 but your getting into your own, and into an independence of him,
 he thinks himself equal to any thing, and so he has a mind to fight
 Lovelace with his own weapons.
 Don't you remember his pragmatical triumph, as told you by your aunt,
 and prided in by that saucy Betty Barnes, from his own foolish mouth?*
      * See Vol.II. Letter XLVII.
 I expect nothing from your letter to your aunt. I hope Lovelace will
 never know the contents of it. In every one of yours, I see that he
 as warmly resents as he dares the little confidence you have in him. I
 should resent it too, were I he; and knew that I deserved better.
 Don't be scrupulous about clothes, if you think of putting yourself into
 the protection of the ladies of his family. They know how matters stand
 between you and your relations, and love you never the worse for the
 silly people's cruelty.
 I know you won't demand possession of your estate. But give him a right
 to demand it for you; and that will be still better.
 Adieu, my dear! May heaven guide and direct you in all your steps, is
 the daily prayer of
 Your ever affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.
 LETTER LI
 MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. FRIDAY, APRIL 21.
 Thou, Lovelace, hast been long the entertainer; I the entertained. Nor
 have I been solicitous to animadvert, as thou wentest along, upon thy

 be her protection and security. But now that I find thou hast so far
 succeeded, as to induce her to come to town, and to choose her lodgings
 in a house, the people of which will too probably damp and suppress any
 honourable motions which may arise in thy mind in her favour, I cannot
