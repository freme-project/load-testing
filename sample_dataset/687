I am to have a visit from her to-morrow. And, since I have refused so
 much as to hear from my brother and sister what the noble settlements
 are to be, she is to acquaint me with the particulars; and to receive

 are owing to nothing else: for, as I said, all his courtship is to
 them; and I have no opportunity of saying no, to one who asks me not the

 I have had the expected conference with my aunt.
 I have been obliged to hear the man's proposals from her; and have been
 told also what their motives are for espousing his interest with so much
 warmth. I am even loth to mention how equally unjust it is for him to
 make such offers, or for those I am bound to reverence to accept of
