But having gone thus far, I should be unhappy, if after marriage, in the
 petulance of ill humour, I had it to reproach myself, that I did not try
 her to the utmost.  And yet I don't know how it is, but this lady, the
 moment I come into her presence, half-assimilates me to her own virtue.--
 Once or twice (to say nothing of her triumph over me on Sunday night) I
 was prevailed upon to fluster myself, with an intention to make some
 advances, which, if obliged to recede, I might lay upon raised spirits:
 but the instant I beheld her, I was soberized into awe and reverence: and
 the majesty of her even visible purity first damped, and then extinguished,
 my double flame.
 What a surprisingly powerful effect, so much and so long in my power she!
 so instigated by some of her own sex, and so stimulated by passion I!--
 How can this be accounted for in a Lovelace!
 But what a heap of stuff have I written!--How have I been run away with!
 --By what?--Canst thou say by what?--O thou lurking varletess CONSCIENCE!
 --Is it thou that hast thus made me of party against myself?--How camest
 thou in?--In what disguise, thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable
 hours?--Stand thou, with fate, but neuter in this controversy; and, if I
 cannot do credit to human nature, and to the female sex, by bringing down
 such an angel as this to class with and adorn it, (for adorn it she does
 in her very foibles,) then I am all your's, and never will resist you
 more.
 Here I arose.  I shook myself.  The window was open.  Always the
 troublesome bosom-visiter, the intruder, is flown.--I see it yet!--And
 now it lessens to my aching eye!--And now the cleft air is closed after it,
 and it is out of sight!--and once more I am
 ROBERT LOVELACE.
