attend me. As I had declined the service of either of the young Misses
 Sorlings, he was extremely solicitous, he said, that I should have a
 servant in whose integrity I might confide.
 I told him, that you would be so kind as to send to engage Hannah, if
 possible.
 If any thing, he said, should prevent Hannah from coming, suppose he
 himself waited upon Miss Howe, to desire her to lend me her servant till
 I was provided to my mind?
 I said, your mother's high displeasure at the step I had taken, (as she
 supposed, voluntarily,) had deprived me of an open assistance of that
 sort from you.
 He was amazed, so much as Mrs. Howe herself used to admire me, and so
 great an influence as Miss Howe was supposed, and deserved to have
 over her mother, that Mrs. Howe should take upon herself to be so much
 offended with me. He wished that the man, who took such pains to keep up
 and enflame the passions of my father and uncles, were not at the bottom
 of this mischief too.
 I was afraid, I said, that my brother was: or else my uncle Antony, I
 dared to say, would not have taken such pains to set Mrs. Howe against
 me, as I understood he had done.
 Since I had declined visiting Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, he asked me,
 if I should admit of a visit from his cousin Montague, and accept of a
 servant of hers for the present?
 That was not, I said, an acceptable proposal: but I would first see if
 my friends would send me my clothes, that I might not make such a giddy
 and runaway appearance to any of his relations.
 If I pleased, he would take another journey to Windsor, to make a more
 particular inquiry amongst the canons, or in any worthy family.
 Were not his objections as to the publicness of the place, I asked him,
 as strong now as before?
