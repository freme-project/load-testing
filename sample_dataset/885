the proof, as you call it. My conduct must then have a faulty appearance
 at least, and I will endeavour to rectify it. But of this I assure you,
 that whatever interpretation my words were capable of, I intended not

 mind, what it became a person of my sex and character to be and to
 do, in such an unhappy situation, where the imputed love is thought an
 undutiful, and therefore a criminal passion; and where the supported
 object of it is a man of faulty morals too. And I am sure you will
 excuse my desire of appearing at those times the person I ought to be;
 had I no other view in it but to merit the continuance of your good
 opinion.
 But that I may acquit myself of having reserves--O, my dear, I must here
 break off--!

 the answer I was writing to yours of yesterday; and which, possibly,

 friends, through the good Mrs. Norton.
 It seems they had sent to her yesterday, to be here this day, to take
 their instructions, and to try what she could do with me. It would,
 at least, I suppose they thought, have this effect; to render me
