 There, Miss Howe, is the reason given for their jehu-driving.
 Mr. Solmes declared, that he was determined to persevere while my
 brother gave him any hopes, and while my father stood firm.
 My sister told my brother, that he hit me charmingly on the reason why

 Some lively, and, I suppose, witty answer, my brother returned; for he
 and Mr. Solmes laughed outrageously upon it, and Bella, laughing too,
 called him a naughty man: but I heard no more of what they said; they
 walked on into the garden.
 If you think, my dear, that what I have related did not again fire me,

 permitted to go thither? I will engage to see nobody they would not have
