She comes! She comes! And the sun is just rising to attend her! Adieu!
 Be half as happy as I am (for all diffidencies, like night-fogs before
 the sun, disperse at her approach) and, next myself, thou wilt be the
 happiest man in the world.
 LETTER VI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12.
 I will pursue my melancholy story.
 Being thus hurried to the chariot, it would have been to no purpose to
 have refused entering into it, had he not in my fright lifted me in, as
 he did: and it instantly drove away a full gallop, and stopped not till
 it brought us to St. Alban's; which was just as the day shut in.
 I thought I should have fainted several times by the way. With uplifted
 hands and eyes, God protect me! said I often to myself: Can it be I,
 that am here! My eyes running over, and my heart ready to burst with
 sighs as involuntarily as my flight.
 How different, how inexpressibly different, the gay wretch; visibly
 triumphing (as I could not but construe his almost rapturous joy) in the
 success of his arts! But overflowing with complimental flourishes, yet
 respectfully distant his address, all the way we flew; for that, rather
 than galloping, was the motion of the horses; which took, as I believe,
 a round-about way, to prevent being traced.
 I have reason to think, there were other horsemen at his devotion; three
 or four different persons, above the rank of the servants, galloping by
 us now-and-then, on each side of the chariot: but he took no notice
 of them; and I had too much grief, mingled with indignation,
 notwithstanding all his blandishments, to ask any questions about them,
 or any thing else.
 Think, my dear, what were my thoughts on alighting from the chariot;
 having no attendant of my own sex; no clothes but what I had on, and
 those little suited to such a journey as I had already taken, and was
