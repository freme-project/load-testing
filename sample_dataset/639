greater faults her errors were owing, and not to a weak or reproachable
 heart. As far as it is consistent with human frailty, and as far as she
 could be perfect, considering the people she had to deal with, and those
 with whom she was inseparably connected, she is perfect. To have been
 impeccable, must have left nothing for the Divine Grace and a purified
 state to do, and carried our idea of her from woman to angel. As such is

 Besides the four principal person, several others are introduced, whose
 letters are characteristic: and it is presumed that there will be found

 among the men, and the second character among the women, such strokes of
 gayety, fancy, and humour, as will entertain and divert, and at the same

 but with what may be called instantaneous descriptions and reflections

 also with affecting conversations; many of them written in the dialogue
 or dramatic way.
 'Much more lively and affecting,' says one of the principal character,
 'must be the style of those who write in the height of a present
 distress; the mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty (the events then
 hidden in the womb of fate;) than the dry, narrative, unanimated style
 of a person relating difficulties and danger surmounted, can be; the
 relater perfectly at ease; and if himself unmoved by his own story, not
 likely greatly to affect the reader.'
