LETTER XV
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FRIDAY, MARCH 3.
 I have both your letters at once. It is very unhappy, my dear, since
 your friends will have you marry, that a person of your merit should be
 addressed by a succession of worthless creatures, who have nothing but
 their presumption for their excuse.
 That these presumers appear not in this very unworthy light to some of
 your friends, is, because their defects are not so striking to them
 as to others.--And why? Shall I venture to tell you?--Because they are
 nearer their own standard--Modesty, after all, perhaps has a concern in
 it; for how should they think that a niece or sister of theirs [I will
 not go higher, for fear of incurring your displeasure] should be an
 angel?
 But where indeed is the man to be found (who has the least share of due
 diffidence) that dares to look up to Miss Clarissa Harlowe with hope, or
 with any thing but wishes? Thus the bold and forward, not being sensible
 of their defects, aspire; while the modesty of the really worthy fills
 them with too much reverence to permit them to explain themselves. Hence
 your Symmes's, your Byron's, your Mullins's, your Wyerley's (the best
 of the herd), and your Solmes's, in turn, invade you--Wretches that,
 looking upon the rest of your family, need not despair of succeeding in
 an alliance with it--But to you, what an inexcusable presumption!
 Yet I am afraid all opposition will be in vain. You must, you will, I
 doubt, be sacrificed to this odious man. I know your family. There will
 be no resisting such baits as he has thrown out. O, my dear, my beloved
 friend! and are such charming qualities, is such exalted merit, to be
 sunk in such a marriage!--You must not, your uncle tells your mother,
 dispute their authority. AUTHORITY! what a full word is that in the
 mouth of a narrow-minded person, who happened to be born thirty years
 before one!--Of your uncles I speak; for as to the paternal authority,
