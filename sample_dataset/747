plead, a dutiful child. You have indeed had no cause to be otherwise. No
 child was ever more favoured. Whether you will discredit all your past
 behaviour; whether, at a time and upon an occasion, that the highest
 instance of duty is expected from you (an instance that is to crown
 all); and when you declare that your heart is free--you will give that
 instance; or whether, having a view to the independence you may claim,
 (for so, Clary, whatever be your motive, it will be judged,) and which
 any man you favour, can assert for you against us all; or rather for
 himself in spite of us--whether, I say, you will break with us all;
 and stand in defiance of a jealous father, needlessly jealous, I will
 venture to say, of the prerogatives of his sex, as to me, and still ten
 times more jealous of the authority of a father;--this is now the point
 with us. You know your father has made it a point; and did he ever give
 up one he thought he had a right to carry?
 Too true, thought I to myself! And now my brother has engaged my father,
 his fine scheme will walk alone, without needing his leading-strings;
 and it is become my father's will that I oppose; not my brother's
 grasping views.
 I was silent. To say the truth, I was just then sullenly silent. My
 heart was too big. I thought it was hard to be thus given up by
 my mother; and that she should make a will so uncontroulable as my
 brother's, her will.--My mother, my dear, though I must not say so, was
 not obliged to marry against her liking. My mother loved my father.
 My silence availed me still less.
 I see, my dear, said she, that you are convinced. Now, my good
 child--now, my Clary, do I love you! It shall not be known, that you
 have argued with me at all. All shall be imputed to that modesty which
 has ever so much distinguished you. You shall have the full merit of
 your resignation.
 I wept.
