take a step so disagreeable, and so derogatory to my honour. And having
 told him, that I will endeavour to obtain leave to dine in the Ivy
 Summer-house,* and to send Betty of some errand, when there, I leave the
 rest to him; but imagine, that about four o'clock will be a proper time
 for him to contrive some signal to let me know he is at hand, and for me
 to unbolt the garden-door.'
      * The Ivy Summer-house (or Ivy Bower, as it was sometimes
      called in the family) was a place, that from a girl, this
      young lady delighted in. She used, in the summer months,
      frequently to sit and work, and read, and write, and draw,
      and (when permitted) to breakfast, and dine, and sometimes
      to sup, in it; especially when Miss Howe, who had an equal
      liking to it, was her visiter and guest.
 She describes it, in another letter (which appears not) as 'pointing to
 a pretty variegated landscape of wood, water, and hilly country; which
 had pleased her so much, that she had drawn it; the piece hanging up, in
 her parlous, among some of her other drawings.'
 I added, by way of postscript, 'That their suspicions seeming to
 increase, I advise him to contrive to send or some to the usual place,
 as frequently as possible, in the interval of time till Monday morning
 ten or eleven o'clock; as something may possibly happen to make me alter
 my mind.'
 O my dear Miss Howe!--what a sad, sad thing is the necessity, forced
 upon me, for all this preparation and contrivance!--But it is now too
 late!--But how!--Too late, did I say?--What a word is that!--What a
 dreadful thing, were I to repent, to find it to be too late to remedy
 the apprehended evil!
 SATURDAY, TEN O'CLOCK.
 Mr. Solmes is here. He is to dine with his new relations, as Betty tells
 me he already calls them.
