I do not imagine, that you yourself will say, he sat for the picture
 you have drawn. And yet, upon the whole, it is not greatly to his
 disadvantage. Were I at ease in my mind, I would venture to draw a much
 more amiable and just likeness.
 If Mr. Hickman has not that assurance which some men have, he has that
 humility and gentleness which many want: and which, with the infinite
 value he has for you, will make him one of the fittest husbands in the
 world for a person of your vivacity and spirit.
 Although you say I would not like him myself, I do assure you, if Mr.
 Solmes were such a man as Mr. Hickman, in person, mind, and behaviour,
 my friends and I had never disagreed about him, if they would not have
 permitted me to live single; Mr. Lovelace (having such a character as
 he has) would have stood no chance with me. This I can the more boldly

 and fear, this man will be able to inspire one with a much greater
 proportion of the latter, than I imagine is compatible with the former,
 to make a happy marriage.
 I am glad you own, that you like no one better than Mr. Hickman. In a
 little while, I make no doubt, you will be able, if you challenge
 your heart upon it, to acknowledge, that you like not any man so well:
 especially, when you come to consider, that the very faults you find in
 Mr. Hickman, admirably fit him to make you happy: that is to say, if it
 be necessary to your happiness, that you should have your own will in
 every thing.
 But let me add one thing: and that is this:--You have such a sprightly
 turn, that, with your admirable talents, you would make any man in the
 world, who loved you, look like a fool, except he were such a one as
 Lovelace.
 Forgive me, my dear, for my frankness: and forgive me, also, for so soon
 returning to subject so immediately relative to myself, as those I now
