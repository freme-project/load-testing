denying might have been all her own, and to lay the stronger obligation
 upon her saucy daughter.
 She wrote such a widow-like refusal when she went from me, as might not
 exclude hope in any other wooer; whatever it may do in Mr. Tony Harlowe.
 It will be my part, to take care to beat her off the visit she half-
 promises to make him (as you will see in her answer) upon condition that
 he will withdraw his suit.  For who knows what effect the old bachelor's
 exotics [far-fetched and dear-bought you know is a proverb] might
 otherwise have upon a woman's mind, wanting nothing but unnecessaries,
 gewgaws, and fineries, and offered such as are not easily to be met with,
 or purchased?
 Well, but now I give you leave to read here, in this place, the copy of
 my mother's answer to your uncle's letter.  Not one comment will I make
 upon it.  I know my duty better.  And here, therefore, taking the liberty
 to hope, that I may, in your present less disagreeable, though not wholly
 agreeable situation, provoke a smile from you, I conclude myself,
 Your ever affectionate and faithful,
 ANNA HOWE.
 MRS. ANNABELLA HOWE, TO ANTONY HARLY, ESQ.
 MR. ANTONY HARLOWE,
 FRIDAY, MAY 19.
 SIR,
 It is not usual I believe for our sex to answer by pen and ink the first
 letter on these occasions. The first letter!  How odd is that!  As if I
 expected another; which I do not.  But then I think, as I do not judge
 proper to encourage your proposal, there is no reason why I should not
 answer in civility, where so great a civility is intended.  Indeed, I was
 always of opinion that a person was entitled to that, and not to ill
 usage, because he had a respect for me.  And so I have often and often
 told my daughter.
