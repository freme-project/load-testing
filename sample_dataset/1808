would have been the better for you, let me tell you.  I dare swear, the
 fine lady you are so likely to be soon happy with, will be far from
 despising them; for I am told, that she writes well, and that all her
 letters are full of sentences.  God convert you! for nobody but he and
 this lady can.
 I have no manner of doubt but that you will marry, as your father, and

 I had went first, she would by this time have known mine.
 There is great wisdom in that saying, God send me a friend, that may tell
 me of my faults: if not, an enemy, and he will.  Not that I am your
