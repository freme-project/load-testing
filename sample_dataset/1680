judgment than of my will.
 I am, my dearest friend,
 Your ever obliged,
 CLARISSA HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXXII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 TUESDAY NIGHT, MAY 16.
 Mr. Lovelace has sent me, by Dorcas, his proposals, as follow:
 'To spare a delicacy so extreme, and to obey you, I write: and the rather
 that you may communicate this paper to Miss Howe, who may consult any of
 her friends you shall think proper to have intrusted on this occasion.  I
 say intrusted; because, as you know, I have given it out to several
 persons, that we are actually married.
 'In the first place, Madam, I offer to settle upon you, by way of
 jointure, your whole estate: and moreover to vest in trustees such a part
 of mine in Lancashire, as shall produce a clear four hundred pounds a
 year, to be paid to your sole and separate use quarterly.
 'My own estate is a clear not nominnal 2000l. per annum.  Lord M.
 proposes to give me possession either of that which he has in Lancashire,
 [to which, by the way, I think I have a better title than he has
 himself,] or that we call The Lawn, in Hertfordshire, upon my nuptials
 with a lady whom he so greatly admires; and to make that I shall choose a
 clear 1000l. per annum.
 'My too great contempt of censure has subjected me to much slander.  It
 may not therefore be improper to assure you, on the word of a gentleman,
 that no part of my estate was ever mortgaged: and that although I lived
 very expensively abroad, and made large draughts, yet that Midsummer-day
 next will discharge all that I owe in the world.  My notions are not all
 bad ones.  I have been thought, in pecuniary cases, generous.  It would
 have deserved another name, had I not first been just.
