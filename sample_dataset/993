     From envy, hurry, noise, and strife,
      The dull impertinence of life,
         In thy retreat I rest:
      Pursue thee to the peaceful groves,
      Where Plato's sacred spirit roves,
         In all thy beauties drest.
      He bad Ilyssus' tuneful stream
      Convey thy philosophic theme
         Of perfect, fair, and good:
      Attentive Athens caught the sound,
      And all her list'ning sons around
         In awful silence stood.
      XII.
      Reclaim'd her wild licentious youth,
      Confess'd the potent voice of Truth,
         And felt its just controul.
      The Passions ceas'd their loud alarms,
      And Virtue's soft persuasive charms
         O'er all their senses stole.
      XIII.
      Thy breath inspires the Poet's song
      The Patriot's free, unbiass'd tongue,
         The Hero's gen'rous strife;
      Thine are retirement's silent joys,
      And all the sweet engaging ties
         Of still, domestic life.
      XIV.
      No more to fabled names confin'd;
      To Thee supreme, all perfect mind,
         My thought direct their flight.
