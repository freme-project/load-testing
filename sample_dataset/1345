concerned that this trial should be made? And who is it that knows this
 lady, that would not stake upon her head the honour of the whole?--Let
 her who would refuse it come forth, and desire to stand in her place.
 I must assure thee, that I have a prodigious high opinion of virtue; as
 I have of all those graces and excellencies which I have not been
 able to attain myself. Every free-liver would not say this, nor think
 thus--every argument he uses, condemnatory of his own actions, as some
 would think. But ingenuousness was ever a signal part of my character.
 Satan, whom thou mayest, if thou wilt, in this case, call my instigator,

 An innocent person, if doubted, must wish to be brought to a fair and

 Well, then, a trial seems necessary for the furthest establishment of
