I wish, if ever I am to be considered as one of the eminent family this
 man is allied to, some of them do not think the worse of me for the
 disgrace I have received. In that case, perhaps, I shall be obliged to

 Mr. Lovelace concludes, 'with repeatedly begging an interview with me;
 and that, this night, if possible: an hour, he says, he is the more
 encouraged to solicit for, as I had twice before made him hope for it.

 resolution of escaping on Monday, unless the reason ceases on which I
 had taken it up; and that I have a prospect of being restored to
 the favour of my friends; at least to my own liberty, and freedom of

 He renews all his vows and promises on this head in so earnest and so
 solemn a manner, that (his own interest, and his family's honour, and
 their favour for me, co-operating) I can have no room to doubt of his
 sincerity.

 assistance.'
 I have not pretended to make a merit with him on this score; for I
 plainly tell him, 'That could I, without an unpardonable sin, die when I
