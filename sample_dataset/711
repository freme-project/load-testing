will carry their point with you.
 I told him my opinion, that you will never be brought to think of such a
 man as Solmes; but that it will probably end in a composition, never to
 have either.
 No man, he said, whose fortunes and alliances are so considerable, ever
 had so little favour from a woman for whose sake he had borne so much.
 I told him my mind as freely as I used to do. But whoever was in fault,
 self being judge? He complained of spies set upon his conduct, and to
 pry into his life and morals, and this by your brother and uncles.
 I told him, that this was very hard upon him; and the more so, as
 neither his life nor morals perhaps would stand a fair inquiry.
 He smiled, and called himself my servant.--The occasion was too fair,
 he said, for Miss Howe, who never spared him, to let it pass.--But, Lord
 help the shallow souls of the Harlowes! Would I believe it! they were
 for turning plotters upon him. They had best take care he did not pay
 them in their own coin. Their hearts were better turned for such works
 than their heads.
 I asked him, If he valued himself upon having a head better turned than
 theirs for such works, as he called them?
 He drew off: and then ran into the highest professions of reverence and
 affection for you.
 The object so meritorious, who can doubt the reality of his professions?
 Adieu, my dearest, my noble friend!--I love and admire you for the
 generous conclusion of your last more than I can express. Though I began
 this letter with impertinent raillery, knowing that you always loved to
 indulge my mad vein; yet never was there a heart that more glowed with
 friendly love, than that of
 Your own ANNA HOWE.
