since, with all your wit, you have not hitherto shown much wisdom, you
 know.
 Get into parliament as soon as you can: for you have talons to make a
 great figure there.  Who so proper to assist in making new holding laws,
 as those whom no law in being could hold?
 Then, for so long as you will give attendance in St. Stephen's chapel--
 its being called a chapel, I hope, will not disgust you: I am sure I have
 known many a riot there--a speaker has a hard time of it! but we peers
 have more decorum--But what was I going to say?--I must go back.

 Archibald Hutcheson said; and it was a very good saying--(to Mr.
 Secretary Craggs, I think it was)--'I look upon an administration, as
