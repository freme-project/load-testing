free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
 product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great
 Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
 the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last
 week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
 these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
 for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has
 now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty
 Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss
 Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
 attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,
 and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
 considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the
 future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has
 been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,
 and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small
 estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress
 is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
 make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a
 British peeress.'"
 "Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.

 to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it
 would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen
 intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would
 return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
 taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on
 Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
 taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
 Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices
