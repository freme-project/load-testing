taken, although I could not perhaps acquit myself to some of my severest
 judges, of an imprudence previous to it. You, I am sure, would pity me,
 if you knew all I could say, and how miserable I am in the forfeiture of
 the good opinion of all my friends.
 I flatter myself, that their favour is yet retrievable: but, whatever be
 the determination at Harlowe-place, do not you, my dearest Aunt, deny
 me the favour of a few lines to inform me if there can be any hope of
 a reconciliation upon terms less shocking than those heretofore
 endeavoured to be imposed upon me; or if (which God forbid!) I am to be
 for ever reprobated.
 At least, my dear Aunt, procure for me the justice of my wearing
 apparel, and the little money and other things which I wrote to my
 sister for, and mention in the enclosed to you; that I may not be
 destitute of common conveniencies, or be under a necessity to owe an
 obligation for such, where, at present, however, I would least of all
 owe it.
 Allow me to say, that had I designed what happened, I might (as to the
 money and jewels at least) have saved myself some of the mortification
 which I have suffered, and which I still further apprehend, if my
 request be not complied with.
 If you are permitted to encourage an eclaircissment of what I hint, I
 will open my whole heart to you, and inform you of every thing.
 If it be any pleasure to have me mortified, be pleased to let it be
 known, that I am extremely mortified. And yet it is entirely from my
 own reflections that I am so, having nothing to find fault with in the
 behaviour of the person from whom every evil was to be apprehended.
 The bearer, having business your way, will bring me your answer on
 Saturday morning, if you favour me according to my hopes. I knew not
 that I should have this opportunity till I had written the above.
 I am, my dearest Aunt, Your ever dutiful, CL. HARLOWE.
