he did, to her refusal. But he dare not--What can one say of so various
 a man?--I am now again out of conceit with him. I wish I were fairly out
 of his power.
      * See Vol.I. Letters II. and III.
 He has sent up three times to beg admittance; in the two last with
 unusual earnestness. But I have sent him word, I will finish what I am
 about.
 What to do about going from this place, I cannot tell. I could stay
 here with all my heart, as I have said to him: the gentlewoman and her
 daughters are desirous that I will: although not very convenient for
 them, I believe, neither: but I see he will not leave me, while I do--so
 I must remove somewhere.
 I have long been sick of myself: and now I am more and more so. But
 let me not lose your good opinion. If I do, that loss will complete the
 misfortunes of
 Your CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER XXX
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY NIGHT, APRIL 16.
 I may send to you, although you are forbid to write to me; may I
 not?--For that is not a correspondence (is it?) where letters are not
 answered.
 I am strangely at a loss what to think of this man. He is a perfect
 Proteus. I can but write according to the shape he assumes at the time.
 Don't think me the changeable person, I beseech you, if in one letter I
 contradict what I wrote in another; nay, if I seem to contradict what
 I said in the same letter: for he is a perfect camelion; or rather more
 variable than the camelion; for that, it is said, cannot assume the
 red and the white; but this man can. And though black seems to be
 his natural colour, yet has he taken great pains to make me think him
 nothing but white.
