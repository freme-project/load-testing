family-stock must be impaired into the bargain,' used to put my sister
 out of all patience: and, although she now seems to think a younger
 sister only can be an incumbrance, she was then often proposing to me to
 make a party in our own favour against my brother's rapacious views, as
 she used to call them: while I was for considering the liberties he took
 of this sort, as the effect of a temporary pleasantry, which, in a young
 man, not naturally good-humoured, I was glad to see; or as a foible that
 deserved raillery, but no other notice.
 But when my grandfather's will (of the purport of which in my particular
 favour, until it was opened, I was as ignorant as they) had lopped off
 one branch of my brother's expectation, he was extremely dissatisfied
 with me. Nobody indeed was pleased: for although every one loved me, yet
 being the youngest child, father, uncles, brother, sister, all thought
 themselves postponed, as to matter of right and power [Who loves not
 power?]: And my father himself could not bear that I should be made
 sole, as I may call it, and independent; for such the will, as to that
 estate and the powers it gave, (unaccountably, as they all said,) made
 To obviate, therefore, every one's jealousy, I gave up to my father's
 management, as you know, not only the estate, but the money bequeathed
 me (which was a moiety of what my grandfather had by him at his death;
 the other moiety being bequeathed to my sister); contenting myself
 to take as from his bounty what he was pleased to allow me, without
 desiring the least addition to my annual stipend. And then I hoped I had
 laid all envy asleep: but still my brother and sister (jealous, as now
 is evident, of my two uncles' favour of me, and of the pleasure I had
 given my father and them by this act of duty) were every now-and-then
 occasionally doing me covert ill offices: of which, however, I took the
 less notice, when I was told of them, as I thought I had removed the
 cause of their envy; and I imputed every thing of that sort to the
 petulance they are both pretty much noted for.
