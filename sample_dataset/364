was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a
 human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between
 the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the
 weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
 away into the river."
 "But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the
 room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
 "No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose
