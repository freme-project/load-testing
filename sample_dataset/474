however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
 bearing upon the case."

 "Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
 the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
 fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the
 gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
 appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
 the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our
 way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
 "Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of
 the general public were present, then?"
 "Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is
 open."
 "This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
 "No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
 common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
 really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
 "Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less
 cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
 on re-entering her father's house?"
 "I saw her in conversation with her maid."
 "And who is her maid?"
 "Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California
 with her."
 "A confidential servant?"
 "A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
 her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they
 look upon these things in a different way."
 "How long did she speak to this Alice?"
