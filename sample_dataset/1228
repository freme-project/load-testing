My cousin Dolly Hervey slid the enclosed letter into my hand, as I
 passed by her, coming out of the garden.
 DEAREST MADAM,
 I have got intelligence from one who pretends to know every thing,
 that you must be married on Wednesday morning to Mr. Solmes. Perhaps,
 however, she says this only to vex me; for it is that saucy creature
 Betty Barnes. A license is got, as she says: and so far she went as to
 tell me (bidding me say nothing, but she knew I would) that Mr. Brand is
 to marry you. For Dr. Lewen I hear, refuses, unless your consent can
 be obtained; and they have heard that he does not approve of their
 proceedings against you. Mr. Brand, I am told, is to have his fortune
 made by uncle Harlowe and among them.
 You will know better than I what to make of all these matters; for
 sometimes I think Betty tells me things as if I should not tell you,
 and yet expects that I will.* For there is great whispering between Miss
 Harlowe and her; and I have observed that when their whispering is over,
 Betty comes and tells me something by way of secret. She and all the
 world know how much I love you: and so I would have them. It is an
 honour to me to love a young lady who is and ever was an honour to all
 her family, let them say what they will.
      * It is easy for such of the readers as have been attentive
      to Mr. Lovelace's manner of working, to suppose, from this
      hint of Miss Hervey's, that he had instructed his double-
      faced agent to put his sweet-heart Betty upon alarming Miss
      Hervey, in hopes she would alarm her beloved cousin, (as we
      see she does,) in order to keep her steady to her
      appointment with him.
 But from a more certain authority than Betty's I can assure you (but I
 must beg of you to burn this letter) that you are to be searched
 once more for letters, and for pen and ink; for they know you write.
