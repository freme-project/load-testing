Solmes! the latter standing sneaking behind the door, so that I saw him
 not, till I was mockingly led by the hand into the room by my brother.
 And then I started as if I had beheld a ghost.
 You are to sit down, Clary.
 And what then, Brother?
 Why then, you are to put off that scornful look, and hear what Mr.
 Solmes has to say to you.
 Sent down for to be baited again, thought I!
 Madam, said Mr. Solmes, as if in haste to speak, lest he should not have
 an opportunity given him, [and indeed he judged right,] Mr. Lovelace is
 a declared marriage hater, and has a design upon your honour, if ever--
 Base accuser! said I, in a passion, snatching my hand from my brother,
 who was insolently motioning to give it to Mr. Solmes; he has not!--he
 dares not!--But you have, if endeavouring to force a free mind be to
 dishonour it!
 O thou violent creature! said my brother--but not gone yet--for I was
 rushing away.
 What mean you, Sir, [struggling vehemently to get away,] to detain me
 thus against my will?
 You shall not go, Violence; clasping his unbrotherly arms about me.
 Then let not Mr. Solmes stay.--Why hold you me thus? he shall not for
 your own sake, if I can help it, see how barbarously a brother can treat
 a sister who deserves not evil treatment.
 And I struggled so vehemently to get from him, that he was forced to
 quit my hand; which he did with these words--Begone then, Fury!--how
 strong is will!--there is no holding her.
 And up I flew to my chamber, and locked myself in, trembling and out of
 breath.
 In less than a quarter of an hour, up came Betty. I let her in upon her
 tapping, and asking (half out of breath too) for admittance.
