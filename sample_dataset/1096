power.
 'I express my high disapprobation of the methods he takes to come
 at what passes in a private family. The pretence of corrupting other
 people's servants, by way of reprisal for the spies they have set upon
 him, I tell him, is a very poor excuse; and no more than an attempt to
 justify one meanness by another.
 'There is, I observe to him, a right and a wrong in every thing, let
 people put what glosses they please upon their action. To condemn a
 deviation, and to follow it by as great a one, what, I ask him, is this,
 but propagating a general corruption?--A stand must be made somebody,
 turn round the evil as many as may, or virtue will be lost: And shall it
 not be I, a worthy mind would ask, that shall make this stand?
 'I leave him to judge, whether his be a worthy one, tried by this rule:
 And whether, knowing the impetuosity of his own disposition, and the
 improbability there is that my father and family will ever be reconciled
 to him, I ought to encourage his hopes?
 'These spots and blemishes, I further tell him, give me not earnestness
 enough for any sake but his own, to wish him in a juster and nobler
 train of thinking and acting; for that I truly despised many of the ways
 he allows himself in: our minds are therefore infinitely different:
 and as to his professions of reformation, I must tell him, that
 profuse acknowledgements, without amendment, are but to me as so many
 anticipating concessions, which he may find much easier to make, thane
 either to defend himself, or amend his errors.
 'I inform him, that I have been lately made acquainted' [and so I have
 by Betty, and she by my brother] 'with the weak and wanton airs he gives
 himself of declaiming against matrimony. I severely reprehend him on
 this occasion: and ask him, with what view he can take so witless, so
 despicable a liberty, in which only the most abandoned of men allow
 themselves, and yet presume to address me?
