purpose, I know not whose reputation would be safe. I love a virtuous
 character, as much in man as in woman. I think it is requisite, and as
 meritorious, in the one as in the other. And, if left to myself, I would
 prefer a person of such a character to royalty without it.
 Why then, said my uncle--
 Give me leave, Sir--but I may venture to say, that many of those who
 have escaped censure, have not merited applause.
 Permit me to observe further, That Mr. Solmes himself may not be
 absolutely faultless. I never head of his virtues. Some vices I have
 heard of--Excuse me, Mr. Solmes, I speak to your face--The text about
 casting the first stone affords an excellent lesson.
 He looked down; but was silent.
 Mr. Lovelace may have vices you have not. You may have others, which
 he has not. I speak not this to defend him, or to accuse you. No man is
 bad, no one is good, in every thing. Mr. Lovelace, for example, is said
 to be implacable, and to hate my friends: that does not make me value
 him the more: but give me leave to say, that they hate him as much. Mr.
 Solmes has his antipathies, likewise; very strong ones, and those to his
 own relations; which I don't find to be the other's fault; for he lives
 well with his--yet he may have as bad:--worse, pardon me, he cannot
 have, in my poor opinion: for what must be the man, who hates his own
 flesh?
 You know not, Madam; You know not, Niece; all in one breath. You know
 not, Clary;
 I may not, nor do I desire to know Mr. Solmes's reasons. It concerns not
 me to know them: but the world, even the impartial part of it, accuses
 him. If the world is unjust or rash, in one man's case, why may it not
 be so in another's? That's all I mean by it. Nor can there by a greater
 sign of want of merit, than where a man seeks to pull down another's
 character, in order to build up his own.
