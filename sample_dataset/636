when your master had gone out."
 
 "You have it, sir, just as it happened."
 
 "I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
 you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And
 here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
 Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
 as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
 questionable one."
 
 And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
 copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
 was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
 his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
 probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
 difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
 married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
 flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
 the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
 Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
 interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
 of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
 Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
