readiness, in one point, at least, to oblige your friends; one of whom
 you may, if you please to deserve it, reckon, though but a brother,
 JAMES HARLOWE.
 P.S. If you are disposed to see Mr. Solmes, and to make some excuses
 to him for past conduct, in order to be able to meet him somewhere else
 with the less concern to yourself for your freedoms with him, he shall
 attend you where you please.
 If you have a mind to read the settlements, before they are read to you
 for your signing, they shall be sent you up--Who knows, but they will
 help you to some fresh objections?--Your heart is free, you know--It
 must--For, did you not tell your mother it was? And will the pious
 Clarissa fib to her mamma?
 I desire no reply. The case requires none. Yet I will ask you, Have you,
 Miss, no more proposals to make?

 I was so vexed when I came to the end of this letter, (the postscript to
 which, perhaps, might be written after the others had seen the letter,)
 that I took up my pen, with an intent to write to my uncle Harlowe about
 resuming my own estate, in pursuance of your advice. But my heart failed
 me, when I recollected, that I had not one friend to stand by or
 support me in my claim; and it would but the more incense them, without
 answering any good end. Oh! that my cousin were but come!
 Is it not a sad thing, beloved as I thought myself so lately by every
 one, that now I have not one person in the world to plead for me, to
 stand by me, or who would afford me refuge, were I to be under the
 necessity of asking for it!--I who had the vanity to think I had as
 many friends as I saw faces, and flattered myself too, that it was not
 altogether unmerited, because I saw not my Maker's image, either in man,
 woman, or child, high or low, rich or poor, whom, comparatively, I
 loved not as myself.--Would to heaven, my dear, that you were married!
