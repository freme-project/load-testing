Then will Miss Howe warn her to keep close.  Then will my protection be
 again necessary.  This will do, I believe.  Any thing from Miss Howe
 must.
 Joseph Leman is a vile fellow with her, and my implement.  Joseph, honest
 Joseph, as I call him, may hang himself.  I have played him off enough,
 and have very little further use for him.  No need to wear one plot to
 the stumps, when I can find new ones every hour.
 Nor blame me for the use I make of my talents.  Who, that hath such, will
 let 'em be idle?
 Well, then, I will find a Singleton; that's all I have to do.
 Instantly find one!--Will!
 Sir--
 This moment call me hither thy cousin Paul Wheatly, just come from sea,
 whom thou wert recommending to my service, if I were to marry, and keep
 a pleasure-boat.
 Presto--Will's gone--Paul will be here presently.  Presently to Mrs.
 Howe's.  If Paul be Singleton's mate, coming from his captain, it will do
 as well as if it were Singleton himself.
 Sally, a little devil, often reproaches me with the slowness of my
 proceedings.  But in a play does not the principal entertainment lie in
 the first four acts?  Is not all in a manner over when you come to the
 fifth?  And what a vulture of a man must he be, who souses upon his prey,
 and in the same moment trusses and devours?
 But to own the truth.  I have overplotted myself.  To my make my work
 secure, as I thought, I have frighted the dear creature with the sight of
 my four Hottentots, and I shall be a long time, I doubt, before I can
 recover my lost ground.  And then this cursed family at Harlowe-place
 have made her out of humour with me, with herself, and with all the
 world, but Miss Howe, who, no doubt, is continually adding difficulties
 to my other difficulties.
