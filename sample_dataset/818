misfortunes, were such a case to happen?--Let me tell you plainly,
 that the man who could treat me as a wife, worse than you of late have
 treated me as a sister, must be a barbarous man indeed.
 Ask yourself, I pray you, Sir, if you would thus have treated your
 sister Bella, had she thought fit to receive the addresses of the man so
 much hated by you?--If not, let me caution you, my Brother, not to take
 your measures by what you think will be borne, but rather by what ought

 purpose: I hope you will not give me reason to confirm my apprehensions,
 that it will be owing to you if it be not accepted.
 It is a sad thing to have it to say, without being conscious of ever
