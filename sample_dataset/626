overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran
 as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
 skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,
 and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
 outside.
 
 "'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it
 must be when I saw the door open.'
 
 "'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
 
 "'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how
 caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened
 you, my dear young lady?'
 
 "But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I
 was keenly on my guard against him.
 
 "'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.
 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was
 frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
 there!'
 
 "'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
 
 "'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
 
 "'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
 
 "'I am sure that I do not know.'
