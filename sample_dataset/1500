restrictions which you yourself had proposed, would have been insisted
 upon. You would have been permitted to go home with me, or with your
 uncle Antony, (with which of us was not agreed upon, because they hoped
 you might be persuaded,) there to stay till the arrival of your cousin
 Morden; or till your father could have borne to see you; or till assured

 This the intention, your father so set upon your compliance, so much in

 stand by itself. This has caused me to send it to Harlowe-place. Expect
 therefore great severity. May you be enabled to support the lot you have
