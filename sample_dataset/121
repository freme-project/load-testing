"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
 place since I awoke into life.  My attention at this time was solely
 directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
 protectors.  I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
 fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
 I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
 person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
 beheld me.  My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
 thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain
 the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means
 be tolerated by my younger protectors.
 "One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
 and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
 and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
 desire, was left alone in the cottage.  When his children had departed,
 he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
 sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.  At first his
 countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
 thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
 instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.
 "My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
 would decide my hopes or realize my fears.  The servants were gone to a
 neighbouring fair.  All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
 excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my
 limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.  Again I rose, and exerting
 all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had
 placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.  The fresh air revived
 me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
 cottage.
 "I knocked.  'Who is there?' said the old man.  'Come in.'
