furnished; but you may have the use of a very handsome parlour in the
 outer-house, if you choose to look into the street.
 A little garden belongs to the inner-house, in which the old gentlewoman
 has displayed a true female fancy; having crammed it with vases,
 flower-pots, and figures, without number.
 As these lodgings seemed to me the most likely to please you, I was more
 particular in my inquiries about them. The apartments she has to let
 are in the inner-house: they are a dining-room, two neat parlours, a
 withdrawing-room, two or three handsome bedchambers, one with a pretty
 light closet in it, which looks into the little garden, all furnished in
 taste.
 A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter were the last who
 lived in them. They have but lately quitted them, on his being presented
 to a considerable church preferment in Ireland. The gentlewoman says
 that he took the lodgings but for three months certain; but liked them
 and her usage so well, that he continued in them two years; and left
 them with regret, though on so good an account. She bragged, that this
 was the way of all the lodgers she ever had, who staid with her four
 times as long as they at first intended.
 I had some knowledge of the colonel, who was always looked upon as a man
 of honour. His relict I never saw before. I think she has a masculine
 air, and is a little forbidding at first: but when I saw her behaviour
 to two agreeable gentlewomen, her husband's nieces, whom, for that
 reason, she calls doubly hers, and heard their praises of her, I could
 impute her very bulk to good humour; since we seldom see your sour
 peevish people plump. She lives reputably, and is, as I find, aforehand
 in the world.
 If these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned, be not
 altogether to your lady's mind, she may continue in them the less while,
 and choose others for herself.
