You are very serious, my dear, in the first of the two letters before
 me, in relation to Mr. Hickman and me; and in relation to my mother and
 me. But as to the latter, you must not be too grave. If we are not well
 together at one time, we are not ill together at another. And while I am
 able to make her smile in the midst of the most angry fit she ever fell

 could help it,) it is a very good sign; a sign that displeasure can
 never go deep, or be lasting. And then a kind word, or kind look, to
 her favourite Hickman, sets the one into raptures, and the other in
 tolerable humour, at any time.
 But your case pains me at heart; and with all my levity, both the good
 folks most sometimes partake of that pain; nor will it be over, as long
 as you are in a state of uncertainty; and especially as I was not able
 to prevail for that protection for you which would have prevented the
 unhappy step, the necessity for which we both, with so much reason,
 deplore.
 I have only to add (and yet it is needless to tell you) that I am, and
 will ever be,
 Your affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.

 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 You tell me, my dear, that my clothes and the little sum of money I left
 behind me, will not be sent me.--But I will still hope. It is yet early
 days. When their passions subside, they will better consider of the

 my friend in this request! O the sweet indulgence! How has my heart
 bled, and how does it still bleed for her!
 You advise me not to depend upon a reconciliation. I do not, I cannot
 depend upon it. But nevertheless, it is the wish next my heart. And as
 to this man, what can I do? You see, that marriage is not absolutely in
