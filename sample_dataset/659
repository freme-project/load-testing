kinsman would not have such an answer on the part of the younger sister,
 as he had on that of the elder.
 In short, Mr. Lovelace's visits were admitted as those of a man who had
 not deserved disrespect from our family; but as to his address to
 me, with a reservation, as above, on my father's part, that he would
 determine nothing without his son. My discretion as to the rest was
 confided in: for still I had the same objections as to the man: nor
 would I, when we were better acquainted, hear any thing but general talk
 from him; giving him no opportunity of conversing with me in private.

 in another manner, which would perhaps have had more force if it had
 come from a person less prejudiced: 'That the man was not fond of
 marrying at all: that he might perhaps have half a score mistresses: and
 that delay might be as convenient for his roving, as for my well-acted
 indifference.' That was her kind expression.

 to be of fortune considerable enough to engage his warmest attention,
 he certainly escaped many mortifications by it: for while my father
 suspended his approbation till my brother's arrival, Mr. Lovelace
 received from every one those civilities which were due to his birth:
