But now I come to the two points in your letter, which most sensibly
 concern me: Thus you put them:
 'Whether I choose not rather to go off [shocking words!] with one of
 my own sex; with my ANNA HOWE--than with one of the other; with Mr.

 convinces me, that I ought not, in your opinion, to attempt it. You no
