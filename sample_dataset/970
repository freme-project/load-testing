display your pedantry by so detestable an allusion or reference to the
 Georgic. Give me leave to tell you, Sir, that if humanity were a branch
 of your studies at the university, it has not found a genius in you for
 mastering it. Nor is either my sex or myself, though a sister, I see
 entitled to the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it
 seems, rather to cultivate the malevolence of his natural temper,
 than any tendency which one might have hoped his parentage, if not his
 education, might have given him to a tolerable politeness.
 I doubt not, that you will take amiss my freedom: but as you have
 deserved it from me, I shall be less and less concerned on that score,
 as I see you are more and more intent to shew your wit at the expense of
 justice and compassion.
 The time is indeed come that I can no longer bear those contempts and
 reflections which a brother, least of all men, is entitled to give. And
 let me beg of you one favour, Sir:--It is this, That you will not give
 yourself any concern about a husband for me, till I shall have the
 forwardness to propose a wife to you. Pardon me, Sir; but I cannot
 help thinking, that could I have the art to get my father of my side, I
 should have as much right to prescribe for you, as you have for me.
 As to the communication you make me, I must take upon me to say, That
 although I will receive, as becomes me, any of my father's commands;
 yet, as this signification is made by a brother, who has shewn of late
 so much of an unbrotherly animosity to me, (for no reason in the world
 that I know if, but that he believes he has, in me, one sister too much
 for his interest,) I think myself entitled to conclude, that such a
 letter as you have sent me, is all your own: and of course to declare,
 that, while I so think it, I will not willingly, nor even without
 violence, go to any place, avowedly to receive Mr. Solmes's visits.
 I think myself so much entitled to resent your infamous hint, and this
 as well for the sake of my sex, as for my own, that I ought to declare,
