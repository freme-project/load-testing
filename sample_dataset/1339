not been something wrong, in this divine creature? And will not the
 reflections upon that wrong (what though it may be construed in my
 favour?*) make me unhappy, when novelty has lost its charms, and when,
 mind and person, she is all my own? Libertines are nicer, if at all
 nice, than other men. They seldom meet with the stand of virtue in
 the women whom they attempt. And, by the frailty of those they have
 triumphed over, they judge of all the rest. 'Importunity and opportunity
 no woman is proof against, especially from the persevering lover, who
 knows how to suit temptations to inclinations:' This, thou knowest, is a
 prime article of the rake's creed.
      * The particular attention of such of the fair sex, as are more apt to
 read for the same of amusement than instruction, is requested to this
 letter of Mr. Lovelace.
 And what! (methinks thou askest with surprise) Dost thou question this
 most admirable of women?--The virtue of a CLARISSA dost thou question?
 I do not, I dare not question it. My reverence for her will not let me
 directly question it. But let me, in my turn, ask thee--Is not, may not
 her virtue be founded rather in pride than in principle? Whose daughter
 is she?--And is she not a daughter? If impeccable, how came she by her
 impeccability? The pride of setting an example to her sex has run away
 with her hitherto, and may have made her till now invincible. But is not
 that pride abated? What may not both men and women be brought to do in a
 mortified state? What mind is superior to calamity? Pride is perhaps the
 principal bulwark of female virtue. Humble a woman, and may she not be
 effectually humbled?
 Then who says Miss Clarissa Harlowe is the paragon of virtue?--Is virtue
 itself?
 All who know her, and have heard of her, it will be answered.
 Common bruit!--Is virtue to be established by common bruit only?--Has
 her virtue ever been proved?--Who has dared to try her virtue?
