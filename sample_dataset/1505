Singleton's rash plot. Such an upshot, as she calls it, of this unhappy
 affair, Heaven avert!
 She flies a thought, that I can less dwell upon--a cruel thought--but
 she has a poor opinion of the purity she compliments me with, if she
 thinks that I am not, by God's grace, above temptation from this sex.
 Although I never saw a man, whose person I could like, before this

 present distresses will?--Rid of both men, I had been now perhaps at my
 aunt Hervey's or at my uncle Antony's; wishing for my cousin Morden's
 arrival, who might have accommodated all.
 I intended, indeed, to have stood it: And, if I had, how know I by whose
