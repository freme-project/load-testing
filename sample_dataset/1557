promise: and if she think not, I can mutter and grumble, and yield again,
 and make a merit of it; and then, unable to live out of her presence,
 soon return.  Nor are women ever angry at bottom for being disobeyed
 through excess of love.  They like an uncontroulable passion.  They like
 to have every favour ravished from them, and to be eaten and drunk quite
 up by a voracious lover.  Don't I know the sex?--Not so, indeed, as yet,
 my Clarissa: but, however, with her my frequent egresses will make me
 look new to her, and create little busy scenes between us.  At the least,
 I may surely, without exception, salute her at parting, and at return;
 and will not those occasional freedoms (which civility will warrant) by
 degrees familiarize my charmer to them?
 But here, Jack, what shall I do with my uncle and aunts, and all my
 loving cousins?  For I understand that they are more in haste to have me
 married than I am myself.
 LETTER IV
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 FRIDAY, APRIL 28.
 Mr. Lovelace is returned already.  My brother's projects were his
 pretence.  I could not but look upon this short absence as an evasion of
 his promise; especially as he had taken such precautions with the people
 below; and as he knew that I proposed to keep close within-doors.  I
 cannot bear to be dealt meanly with; and angrily insisted that he should
 directly set out for Berkshire, in order to engage his cousin, as he had
 promised.
 O my dearest life, said he, why will you banish me from your presence?  I
 cannot leave you for so long a time as you seem to expect I should.  I
 have been hovering about town ever since I left you.  Edgware was the
 farthest place I went to, and there I was not able to stay two hours, for
 fear, at this crisis, any thing should happen.  Who can account for the
 workings of an apprehensive mind, when all that is dear and valuable to
