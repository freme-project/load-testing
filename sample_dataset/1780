But what is become of Lord M.  I trow, that he writes not to me, in
 answer to my invitation?  If he would send me such a letter as I could
 show, it might go a great way towards a perfect reconciliation.  I have
 written to Charlotte about it.  He shall soon hear from me, and that in a

 torture the faithfullest heart in the world?
 She disengaged her hand.  Again I would have snatched it.
 Be quiet, [peevishly withdrawing it.]  And down she sat; a gentle
 palpitation in the beauty of beauties indicating a mingled sullenness and
 resentment; her snowy handkerchief rising and falling, and a sweet flush
