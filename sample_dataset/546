light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
 parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have
 frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
 parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is
 abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he
 derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or
 from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
 power."
 "I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A
 thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
 have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
 this poor creature."
 "We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning
 man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall
 be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the
 mystery."
 We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we
 reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside
 public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining
 like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were
 sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
 standing smiling on the door-step.
 "Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
 A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is
 Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring
 on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates
 of Mr. Rucastle's."
 "You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now
 lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black
 business."
