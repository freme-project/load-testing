My sister said something with great vehemence: but only raising my
 voice, to be heard, without minding her, Pray, Madam, (provokingly
 interrogated I), was he not known to have been as wild a man, when he
 was at first introduced into our family, as he now is said to be? Yet
 then, the common phrases of wild oats, and black oxen, and such-like,
 were qualifiers; and marriage, and the wife's discretion, were to
 perform wonders--but (turning to my sister) I find I have said too much.
 O thou wicked reflecter!--And what made me abhor him, think you, but
 the proof of those villainous freedoms that ought to have had the same
 effect upon you, were you but half so good a creature as you pretend to
 Proof, did you say, Bella! I thought you had not proof?--But you know
 best.
 Was not this very spiteful, my dear?
 Now, Clary, said she, would I give a thousand pounds to know all that is
 in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart at this moment.
 I might let you know for a much less sum, and not be afraid of being
 worse treated than I have been.
 Well, young ladies, I am sorry to see passion run so high between
 you. You know, Niece, (to me,) you had not been confined thus to
 your apartment, could your mother by condescension, or your father by
 authority, have been able to move you. But how can you expect, when
 there must be a concession on one side, that it should be on theirs?
 If my Dolly, who has not the hundredth part of your understanding, were
 thus to set herself up in absolute contradiction to my will, in a point
 so material, I should not take it well of her--indeed I should not.
 I believe not, Madam: and if Miss Hervey had just such a brother, and
 just such a sister [you may look, Bella!] and if both were to aggravate
 her parents, as my brother and sister do mine--then, perhaps, you might
 use her as I am used: and if she hated the man you proposed to her, and
 with as much reason as I do Mr. Solmes--
