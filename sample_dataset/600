dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of
 lectures into a series of tales."
 
 It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
 breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
 Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of
 dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,
 shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
 and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for
 the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been
 silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the
 advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
 having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very
 sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
 
 "At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he
 had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,
 "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of
 these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
 in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,
 at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King
 of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
 problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the
 incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
 outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I
 fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
 
 "The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold
 to have been novel and of interest."
