What, therefore, I am thinking of, is this--'Suppose Mr. Hickman, whose
 good character has gained him every body's respect, should put himself in
 my uncle Harlowe's way?  And (as if from your knowledge of the state of
 things between Mr. Lovelace and me) assure him not only of the above
 particulars, but that I am under no obligations that shall hinder me from
 taking his directions?'
 I submit the whole to your consideration, whether to pursue it at all, or
 in what manner.  But if it be pursued, and if my uncle refuses to
 interest himself in my favour upon Mr. Hickman's application as from you,
 (for so, for obvious reasons, it must be put,) I can then have no hope;
 and my next step, in the mind I am in, shall be to throw myself into the
 protection of the ladies of his family.
 It were an impiety to adopt the following lines, because it would be
 throwing upon the decrees of Providence a fault too much my own.  But
 often do I revolve them, for the sake of the general similitude which
 they bear to my unhappy, yet undersigned error.
       To you, great gods! I make my last appeal:
       Or clear my virtue, or my crimes reveal.
       If wand'ring in the maze of life I run,
       And backward tread the steps I sought to shun,
       Impute my error to your own decree:
       My FEET are guilty: but my HEART is free.
 [The Lady dates again on Monday, to let Miss Howe know, that Mr.
    Lovelace, on observing her uneasiness, had introduced to her Mr.
    Mennell, Mrs. Fretchville's kinsman, who managed all her affairs.  She
    calls him a young officer of sense and politeness, who gave her an
    account of the house and furniture, to the same effect that Mr.
    Lovelace had done before;* as also of the melancholy way Mrs.
    Fretchville is in.
