LETTER XXVI
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY MORN., MARCH 9.
 I have another letter from Mr. Lovelace, although I had not answered his
 former.
 This man, somehow or other, knows every thing that passes in our family.
 My confinement; Hanna's dismission; and more of the resentments and
 resolutions of my father, uncles, and brother, than I can possibly know,
 and almost as soon as the things happen, which he tells me of. He cannot
 come at these intelligencies fairly.
 He is excessively uneasy upon what he hears; and his expressions, both
 of love to me, and resentment to them, are very fervent. He solicits me,
 'To engage my honour to him never to have Mr. Solmes.'
 I think I may fairly promise him that I will not.
 He begs, 'That I will not think he is endeavouring to make to himself
 a merit at any man's expense, since he hopes to obtain my favour on the
 foot of his own; nor that he seeks to intimidate me into a consideration
 for him. But declares, that the treatment he meets with from my family
 is of such a nature, that he is perpetually reproached for not resenting
 it; and that as well by Lord M. and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, as by
 all his other friends: and if he must have no hope from me, he cannot
 answer for what his despair will make him do.'
 Indeed, he says, 'his relations, the ladies particularly, advise him to
 have recourse to a legal remedy: But how, he asks, can a man of honour
 go to law for verbal abuses given by people entitled to wear swords?'
 You see, my dear, that my mother seems as apprehensive of mischief as
 myself; and has indirectly offered to let Shorey carry my answer to the
 letter he sent me before.
 He is full of the favours of the ladies of his family to me: to whom,
 nevertheless, I am personally a stranger; except, that I once saw Miss
 Patty Montague at Mrs. Knolly's.
