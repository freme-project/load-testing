to Heaven I could hear that all the world acquitted my father, or, at
 least, my mother! whose character, before these family feuds broke out,
 was the subject of everyone's admiration. Don't let any body say from
 you, so that it may come to her ear, that she might, from a timely
 exertion of her fine talents, have saved her unhappy child. You will
 observe, my dear, that in her own good time, when she saw there was not
 likely to be an end to my brother's persecutions, she resolved to
 exert herself. But the pragmatical daughter, by the fatal meeting,
 precipitated all, and frustrated her indulgent designs. O my love, I am
 now convinced, by dear experience, that while children are so happy
 as to have parents or guardians whom they may consult, they should not
 presume (no, not with the best and purest intentions) to follow their
 own conceits in material cases.
 A ray of hope of future reconciliation darts in upon my mind, from the
 intention you tell me my mother had to exert herself in my favour, had I
 not gone away. And my hope is the stronger, as this communication points
 out to me that my uncle Harlowe's interest is likely, in my mother's
 opinion, to be of weight, if it could be engaged. It will behove me,
 perhaps, to apply to that dear uncle, if a proper occasion offer.

 Fate is weaving a whimsical web for thy friend; and I see not but I
 shall be inevitably manacled.

 time, and spreading my snares, like an artful fowler, at another, and
 exulting in my contrivances to get this inimitable creature, absolutely
 into my power. Every thing made for me. Her brother and uncles were but
 my pioneers: her father stormed as I directed him to storm: Mrs. Howe
 was acted by the springs I set at work; her daughter was moving for me,
 yet imagined herself plumb against me: and the dear creature herself
