found.
 I knew not, I said, the meaning of these dark hints. I thought the
 cunning she hinted at, on both sides, called rather for contempt than
 applause. I myself might have been put upon artifices which my heart
 disdained to practise, had I given way to the resentment, which, I was
 bold to say, was much more justifiable than the actions that occasioned
 it: that it was evident to me, from what she had said, that their
 present suspicions of me were partly owing to this supposed superior
 cunning of my brother, and partly to the consciousness that the usage I
 met with might naturally produce a reason for such suspicions: that it
 was very unhappy for me to be made the butt of my brother's wit: that it
 would have been more to his praise to have aimed at shewing a kind heart
 than a cunning head: that, nevertheless, I wished he knew himself as
 well as I imagined I knew him; and he would then have less conceit of
 his abilities: which abilities would, in my opinion, be less thought of,
 if his power to do ill offices were not much greater than they.
 I was vexed. I could not help making this reflection. The dupe the
 other, too probably, makes of him, through his own spy, deserved it. But
 I so little approve of this low art in either, that were I but tolerably
 used, the vileness of that man, that Joseph Leman, should be inquired
 into.
 She was sorry, she said, to find that I thought so disparagingly of my
 brother. He was a young man both of learning and parts.
 Learning enough, I said, to make him vain of it among us women: but not
 of parts sufficient to make his learning valuable either to himself or
 to any body else.
 She wished, indeed, that he had more good nature: but she feared that
 I had too great an opinion of somebody else, to think so well of my
 brother as a sister ought: since, between the two, there was a sort of
 rivalry, as to abilities, that made them hate one another.
