upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
 behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when
 seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it
 did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
 back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
 Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
 reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
 delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
 delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
 he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
 brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
 of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
 murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
 overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to
 return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
 kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
 tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
 did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
 in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long
 as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
 McCarthy's innocence.
 It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,
 for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
 "The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.
 "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
 to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his
 very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not
 wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young
 McCarthy."
 "And what did you learn from him?"
