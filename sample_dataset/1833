confined myself too much; and so will have a chair called, and be carried
 to the Park; where I will try to walk half the length of the Mall, or so;
 and in my return, amuse myself at White's or the Cocoa.
 And what will this do?
 Questioning again!--I am afraid thou'rt an infidel, Belford--Why then
 shall I not know if my beloved offers to go out in my absence?--And shall
 I not see whether she receives me with tenderness at my return?  But this
 is not all: I have a foreboding that something affecting will happen
 while I am out.  But of this more in its place.
 And now, Belford, wilt thou, or wilt thou not, allow, that it is a right
 thing to be sick?--Lord, Jack, so much delight do I take in my
 contrivances, that I shall be half sorry when the occasion for them is
 over; for never, never, shall I again have such charming exercise for my
 invention.
 Mean time these plaguy women are so impertinent, so full of reproaches,
 that I know not how to do any thing but curse them.  And then, truly,
 they are for helping me out with some of their trite and vulgar
 artifices.  Sally, particularly, who pretends to be a mighty contriver,
 has just now, in an insolent manner, told me, on my rejecting her
 proffered aids, that I had no mind to conquer; and that I was so wicked
 as to intend to marry, though I would not own it to her.
 Because this little devil made her first sacrifice at my altar, she
 thinks she may take any liberty with me: and what makes her outrageous at
 times is, that I have, for a long time, studiously, as she says, slighted
 her too-readily-offered favours: But is it not very impudent in her to
 think, that I will be any man's successor?  It is not come to that
 neither.  This, thou knowest, was always my rule--Once any other man's,
 and I know it, and never more mine.  It is for such as thou, and thy
 brethren, to take up with harlots.  I have been always aiming at the
 merit of a first discoverer.
