aspect.--But I cannot, cannot see him!
 MONDAY NIGHT.
 The contents of your letter, and my own heavy reflections, rendered me
 incapable of seeing this expecting man.  The first word he asked Dorcas,
 was, If I had received a letter since he had been out?  She told me this;
 and her answer, that I had; and was fasting, and had been in tears ever
 since.
 He sent to desire an interview with me.
 I answered by her, That I was not very well.  In the morning, if better,
 I would see him as soon as he pleased.
 Very humble! was it not, my dear?  Yet he was too royal to take it for
 humility; for Dorcas told me, he rubbed one side of his face impatiently;
 and said a rash word, and was out of humour; stalking about the room.
 Half an hour later, he sent again; desiring very earnestly, that I should
 admit him to supper with me.  He would enter upon no subjects of
 conversation but what I should lead to.
 So I should have been at liberty, you see, to court him!
 I again desired to be excused.
 Indeed, my dear, my eyes were swelled: I was very low spirited; and could
 not think of entering all at once, after the distance I had kept him at
 for several days, into the freedom of conversation which the utter
 rejection I have met with from my relations, as well as your advice, has
 made necessary.
 He sent up to tell me, that as he heard I was fasting, if I would promise
 to eat some chicken which Mrs. Sinclair had ordered for supper, he would
 acquiesce.--Very kind in his anger!  Is he not?
 I promised that I would.  Can I be more preparatively condescending?--How
 happy, I'll warrant, if I may meet him in a kind and forgiving humour!
 I hate myself!  But I won't be insulted.  Indeed I won't, for all this.
