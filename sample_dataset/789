command the good creature to a place worthy of her, pray do for my sake.
 LETTER XXIV
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY, NEAR 12 O'CLOCK.
 The enclosed letter was just now delivered to me. My brother has carried
 all his points.
 I send you also the copy of my answer. No more at this time can I
 write--!
 MONDAY, MAR. 6.
 MISS CLARY,
 By command of your father and mother I write expressly to forbid you to
 come into their presence, or into the garden when they are there: nor
 when they are not there, but with Betty Banes to attend you; except by
 particular license or command.
 On their blessings, you are forbidden likewise to correspond with the
 vile Lovelace; as it is well known you did by means of your sly Hannah.
 Whence her sudden discharge. As was fit.
 Neither are you to correspond with Miss Howe; who has given herself high
 airs of late; and might possibly help on your correspondence with that
 detested libertine. Nor, in short, with any body without leave.
 You are not to enter into the presence of either of your uncles, without
 their leave first obtained. It is a mercy to you, after such a behaviour
 to your mother, that your father refuses to see you.
 You are not to be seen in any apartment of the house you so lately
 governed as you pleased, unless you are commanded down.
 In short, you are strictly to confine yourself to your chamber, except
 now and then, in Betty Barnes's sight (as aforesaid) you take a morning
 or evening turn in the garden: and then you are to go directly, and
 without stopping at any apartment in the way, up or down the back
 stairs, that the sight of so perverse a young creature may not add to
 the pain you have given every body.
