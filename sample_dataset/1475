I enclose the letter from Joseph Leman, which I mentioned to thee in
 mine of Monday last,* with my answer to it. I cannot resist the vanity
 that urges me to the communication. Otherwise, it were better, perhaps,

 her, and dispense the opportunities in my favour, which are only the
 consequences of my own invention.

 broute to bed, as one may say, before your Honner's return: and she got
 colde in her lyin-inn, and lanquitched, and soon died: and the child is
 living; but your Honner never troubles your Honner's hedd about it
