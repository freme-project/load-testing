perfidy of one.
 You remember this, my dear, as I do your innocent observation upon it,
 that you could believe his solemn asseveration and denial: 'For surely,
 said you, the man who would resent, as the highest indignity that could
 be offered to a gentleman, the imputation of a wilful falsehood, would
 not be guilty of one.'
 I insisted upon the extraordinary circumstances in your case;
 particularizing them. I took notice, that Mr. Lovelace's morals were at

 She cannot endure to hear me praise any man but her favourite Hickman;
 upon whom, nevertheless, she generally brings a degree of contempt which
