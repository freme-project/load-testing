 I was guilty, it seems, of going to church, said the indignant charmer;
 and without the company of a man, whose choice it would not have been to

 it did (and indeed once more very lately) just before some tears came
 into my eyes; and I durst hardly trust my face in view of her's.
 What have I done to deserve this impatient exclamation?--Have I, at any
 time, by word, by deeds, by looks, given you cause to doubt my honour, my
