to take it, and had engaged some of the ladies to visit me there, I could
 hardly forbear blaming myself for censuring him as capable of so vile an
 imposture.  But may he not thank himself for acting so very
 unaccountably, and taking such needlessly-awry steps, as he had done,
 embarrassing, as I told him, his own meanings, if they were good?
 LETTER L
 MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
 WEDNESDAY, MAY 24.
 [He gives his friend an account of their interview that morning; and of
    the happy effects of his cousin Montague's letter in his favour.  Her
    reserves, however, he tells him, are not absolutely banished.  But
    this he imputes to form.]
 It is not in the power of woman, says he, to be altogether sincere on
 these occasions.  But why?--Do they think it so great a disgrace to be
 found out to be really what they are?
 I regretted the illness of Mrs. Fretchville; as the intention I had to
 fix her dear self in the house before the happy knot was tied, would have
 set her in that independence in appearance, as well as fact, which was
 necessary to show to all the world that her choice was free; and as the
 ladies of my family would have been proud to make their court to her
 there, while the settlements and our equipages were preparing.  But, on
 any other account, there was no great matter in it; since when my happy
 day was over, we could, with so much convenience, go down to The Lawn, to
 my Lord M.'s, and to Lady Sarah's or Lady Betty's, in turn; which would
 give full time to provide ourselves with servants and other
 accommodations.
 How sweetly the charmer listened!
 I asked her, if she had had the small-pox?
 Ten thousand pounds the worse in my estimation, thought I, if she has
 not; for no one of her charming graces can I dispense with.
