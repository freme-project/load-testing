hereafter, to engage her gratitude, and by degrees her love, is willing
 to overlook all!--'
 [Overlook all, my dear! Mr. Solmes to overlook all! There's a word!]
 'So, Mrs. Norton, if you are convinced, that it is a child's duty to
 submit to her parents' authority, in the most important point as well as
 in the least, I beg you will try your influence over her: I have none:
 her father has none: her uncles neither: although it is her apparent
 interest to oblige us all; for, on that condition, her grandfather's
 estate is not half of what, living and dying, is purposed to be done for
 her. If any body can prevail with her, it is you; and I hope you will
 heartily enter upon this task.'
 The good woman asked, Whether she was permitted to expostulate with them
 upon the occasion, before she came up to me?
 My arrogant brother told her, she was sent for to expostulate with his
 sister, and not with them. And this, Goody Norton [she is always
 Goody with him!] you may tell her, that the treaty with Mr. Solmes is
 concluded: that nothing but her compliance with her duty is wanting;
 of consequence, that there is no room for your expostulation, or hers
 either.
 Be assured of this, Mrs. Norton, said my father, in an angry tone, that
 we will not be baffled by her. We will not appear like fools in this
 matter, and as if we have no authority over our own daughter. We will
 not, in short, be bullied out of our child by a cursed rake, who had
 like to have killed our only son!--And so she had better make a merit
 of her obedience; for comply she shall, if I live; independent as she
 thinks my father's indiscreet bounty has made her of me, her father.
 Indeed, since that, she has never been like she was before. An unjust
 bequest!--And it is likely to prosper accordingly!--But if she marry
 that vile rake Lovelace, I will litigate every shilling with her: tell
 her so; and that the will may be set aside, and shall.
