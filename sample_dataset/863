I am a pretty deal indebted on that score, I intend, before I leave
 these parts (successfully shall I leave them I hope, or I shall be

 half a dozen more therefores, spare thou my Rose-bud.
 An interruption--another letter anon; and both shall go together.

 to tender his service to her, and to bring them her letter: which it
 will be proper for him to report that she has refused to give him.
 Now seest thou not, how many good ends this contrivance answers?
 In the first place, the lady is secured by it, against her own
