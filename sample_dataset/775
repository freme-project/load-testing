have heard you say, Madam, was for years a very good-humoured
 gentleman--unobjectionable in person and manners--but the man proposed
 to me--
 Forbear reflecting upon your father: [Did I, my dear, in what I have
 repeated, and I think they are the very words, reflect upon my father?]
 it is not possible, I must say again, and again, were all men equally
 indifferent to you, that you should be thus sturdy in your will. I am
 tired out with your obstinacy--The most unpersuadable girl--You forget,
 that I must separate myself from you, if you will not comply. You do not

 Dreadful alternative--But is not my sincerity, is not the integrity of
 my heart, concerned in the answer? May not my everlasting happiness

 not sought to ensnare, to entangle me in my own desire of obeying, if
 I could give answers that might be construed into hope?--Forgive

 this!--Settlements drawn!--Patterns sent for!--An early day!--Dear, dear
 Madam, how can I give hope, and not intend to be this man's?
 Ah, girl, never say your heart is free! You deceive yourself if you
 think it is.
 Thus to be driven [and I wrung my hands through impatience] by the
 instigations of a designing, an ambitious brother, and by a sister,
 that--
 How often, Clary, must I forbid your unsisterly reflections?--Does not
 your father, do not your uncles, does not every body, patronize
