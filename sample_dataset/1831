is rather to be her prize, than she his?
 And now, Belford, what dost think?
 That thou art a cursed fellow, if--
 If--no if's--but I shall be very sick to-morrow.  I shall, 'faith.
 Sick!--Why sick?  What a-devil shouldst thou be sick for?
 For more good reasons than one, Jack.
 I should be glad to hear but one.--Sick, quotha!  Of all thy roguish
 inventions I should not have thought of this.
