qualities, in yielding so much as she yields to encroaching spirits
 [you may confine the reflection to your brother, if it will pain you
 to extend it]; and this for the sake of preserving a temporary peace to
 herself; which was the less worth endeavouring to preserve, as it always
 produced a strength in the will of others, which subjected her to an

 resist such a measure!
 Mr. Hickman shall sound Lord M. upon the subject you recommend. But
