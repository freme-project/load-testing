The hourly threatenings of your fine fellow, as well as your own
 unheard-of obstinacy, will account to you for all this. What a hand has
 the best and most indulgent of mothers had with you, who so long pleaded
 for you, and undertook for you; even when others, from the manner of
 your setting out, despaired of moving you!--What must your perverseness
 have been, that such a mother can give you up! She thinks it right so to
 do: nor will take you to favour, unless you make the first steps, by a
 compliance with your duty.
 As for myself, whom perhaps you think hardly of [in very good company,
 if you do, that is my sole consolation]; I have advised, that you may be
 permitted to pursue your own inclinations, (some people need no greater
 punishment than such a permission,) and not to have the house encumbered
 by one who must give them the more pain for the necessity she has laid
 them under of avoiding the sight of her, although in it.
 If any thing I have written appear severe or harsh, it is still in your
 power (but perhaps will not always be so) to remedy it; and that by a
 single word.
 Betty Barnes has orders to obey you in all points consistent with her
 duty to those whom you owe it, as well as she.
 JA. HARLOWE.
 TO JAMES HARLOWE, JUNIOR, ESQ.
 SIR,
 I will only say, That you may congratulate yourself on having so far
 succeeded in all your views, that you may report what you please of me,
 and I can no more defend myself, than if I were dead. Yet one favour,
 nevertheless, I will beg of you. It is this--That you will not occasion
 more severities, more disgraces, that are necessary for carrying into
 execution your further designs, whatever they be, against
 Your unhappy sister, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
