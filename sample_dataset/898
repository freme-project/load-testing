for his sake; they hating ours in return: that he has a very immoral
 character as to women: that knowing this, it is a high degree of
 impurity to think of joining in wedlock with such a man: that he is
 young, unbroken, his passions unsubdued: that he is violent in his
 temper, yet artful; I am afraid vindictive too: that such a husband
 might unsettle me in all my own principles, and hazard my future hopes:
 that his own relations, two excellent aunts, and an uncle, from whom

 indiscreet measures, as will render me inexcusable to myself: for that
 is the test, after all. The world's opinion ought to be but a secondary
 consideration.
 I have said in his praise, that he is extremely ready to own his errors:
 but I have sometimes made a great drawback upon this article, in his
 disfavour; having been ready to apprehend, that this ingenuousness may
 possibly be attributable to two causes, neither of them, by any means,
 creditable to him. The one, that his vices are so much his masters, that
 he attempts not to conquer them; the other, that he may think it policy,
 to give up one half of his character to save the other, when the
 whole may be blamable: by this means, silencing by acknowledgment
 the objections he cannot answer; which may give him the praise of
