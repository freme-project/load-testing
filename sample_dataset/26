discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies
 discontented and unsatisfied.  Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed
 that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and
 unexplored ocean of truth.  Those of his successors in each branch of
 natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's
 apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.
 The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
 with their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little
 more.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal
 lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,

 But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and
 knew more.  I took their word for all that they averred, and I became
 their disciple.  It may appear strange that such should arise in the
 eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in
 the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with
 regard to my favourite studies.  My father was not scientific, and I

 what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from
 the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!
 Nor were these my only visions.  The raising of ghosts or devils was a
 promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of
