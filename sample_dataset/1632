And, let me tell thee, that the lady has already (at Mrs. Sinclair's
 motion) removed her clothes out of the trunks they came in, into an ample
 mahogany repository, where they will lie at full length, and which has
 drawers in it for linen.  A repository, that used to hold the richest
 suits which some of the nymphs put on, when they are to be dressed out,
 to captivate, or to ape quality.  For many a countess, thou knowest, has
 our mother equipped; nay, two or three duchesses, who live upon quality-
 terms with their lords.  But this to such as will come up to her price,
 and can make an appearance like quality themselves on the occasion: for
 the reputation of persons of birth must not lie at the mercy of every
 under-degreed sinner.
 A master-key, which will open every lock in this chest, is put into
 Dorcas's hands; and she is to take care, when she searches for papers,
 before she removes any thing, to observe how it lies, that she may
 replace all to a hair.  Sally and Polly can occasionally help to
 transcribe. Slow and sure with such an Argus-eyed charmer must be all
 my movements.
 It is impossible that one so young and so inexperienced as she is can
 have all her caution from herself; the behaviour of the women so
 unexceptionable; no revellings, no company ever admitted into this inner-
 house; all genteel, quiet, and easy in it; the nymphs well-bred, and
 well-read; her first disgusts to the old one got over.--It must be Miss
 Howe, therefore, [who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our
 class, by honest Sir George Colmar, as thou hast heard,] that makes my
 progress difficult.
 Thou seest, Belford, by the above precautionaries, that I forget nothing.
 As the song says, it is not to be imagined
         On what slight strings
         Depend these things
       On which men build their glory!
