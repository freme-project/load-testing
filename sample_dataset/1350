Don't set your thought so much upon a reconciliation as to prevent your
 laying hold of any handsome opportunity to give yourself a protector;
 such a one as the man will be, who, I imagine, husband-like, will let
 nobody insult you but himself.
 What could he mean by letting slip such a one as that you mention? I
 don't know how to blame you; for how you go beyond silence and blushes,
 when the foolish fellow came with his observances of the restrictions
 which you laid him under when in another situation? But, as I told you
 above, you really strike people into awe. And, upon my word, you did not
 spare him.
 I repeat what I said in my last, that you have a very nice part to act:
 and I will add, that you have a mind that is much too delicate for your
 part. But when the lover is exalted, the lady must be humbled. He is
 naturally proud and saucy. I doubt you must engage his pride, which he
 calls his honour: and that you must throw off a little more of the veil.
 And I would have you restrain your wishes before him, that you had not
 met him, and the like. What signifies wishing, my dear? He will not bear
 it. You can hardly expect that he will.
 Nevertheless, it vexed me to the very bottom of my pride, that any
 wretch of that sex should be able to triumph over Clarissa.
 I cannot, however, but say, that I am charmed with your spirit. So much
 sweetness, where sweetness is requisite; so much spirit, where spirit is
 called for--what a true magnanimity!
 But I doubt, in your present circumstances, you must endeavour after a
 little more of the reserve, in cases where you are displeased with him,
 and palliate a little. That humility which he puts on when you rise upon
 him, is not natural to him.
 Methinks I see the man hesitating, and looking like the fool you paint
 him, under your corrective superiority!--But he is not a fool. Don't put
 him upon mingling resentment with his love.
