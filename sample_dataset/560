"How did you deduce the select?"
 
 "By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
 for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
 hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
 In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
 learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
 American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
 over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
 had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
 to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
 enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
 some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
 better in every way that they should make their position a little
 clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
 particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
 made him keep the appointment."
 
 "But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was
 certainly not very gracious."
 
 "Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be
 very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
 wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
 fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
 and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
 the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
 the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
 these bleak autumnal evenings."
