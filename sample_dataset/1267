took to be all their own.
 But did I say my joy was perfect?--O no!--It receives some abatement
 from my disgusted bride. For how can I endure to think that I owe more
 to her relations' precautions than to her favour for me?--Or even, as
 far as I know, to her preference of me to another man?
 But let me not indulge this thought. Were I to do so, it might cost my
 charmer dear. Let me rejoice, that she has passed the rubicon: that she
 cannot return: that, as I have ordered it, the flight will appear to the
 implacables to be altogether with her own consent: and that if I doubt
 her love, I can put her to trials as mortifying to her niceness, as
 glorious to my pride.--For, let me tell thee, dearly as I love her, if
 I thought there was but the shadow of a doubt in her mind whether she
 preferred me to any man living, I would shew her no mercy.
 TUESDAY, DAY-DAWN.
 But, on the wings of love, I fly to my charmer, who perhaps by this time
 is rising to encourage the tardy dawn. I have not slept a wink of the
 hour and half I lay down to invite sleep. It seems to me, that I am not
 so much body, as to require such a vulgar renovation.
 But why, as in the chariot, as in the inn, at alighting, all
 heart-bursting grief, my dearest creature? SO persecuted as thou wert
 persecuted!--So much in danger of the most abhorred compulsion!--Yet
 grief so unsuspectedly sincere for an escape so critical!--Take care,
 take care, O beloved of my soul! for jealous is the heart in which love
 has erected a temple to thee.
 Yet, it must be allowed, that such a sudden transition must affect her;
 must ice her over. When a little more used to her new situation; when
 her hurries are at an end; when she sees how religiously I shall
 observe all her INJUNCTIONS; she will undoubtedly have the gratitude
 to distinguish between the confinement she has escaped from, and the
 liberty she has reason to rejoice in.
