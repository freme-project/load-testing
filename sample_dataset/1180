I little thought, my dear, what was to follow this supposed
 condescension.
 And then I ran over with blessings for this good news, (and she
 permitted me so to do, by her silence); congratulating myself, that
 I thought my father could not resolve to carry things to the last
 extremity.--
 Hold, Niece, said she, at last--you must not give yourself too much joy
 upon the occasion neither.--Don't be surprised, my dear.--Why look you
 upon me, child, with so affecting an earnestness?--but you must be Mrs.
 Solmes, for all that.
 I was dumb.
 She then told me, that they had undoubted information, that a certain
 desperate ruffian (I must excuse her that word, she said) had prepared
 armed men to way-lay my brother and uncles, and seize me, and carry me
 off.--Surely, she said, I was not consenting to a violence that might be
 followed by murder on one side or the other; perhaps on both.
 I was still silent.
 That therefore my father (still more exasperated than before) had
 changed his resolution as to my going to my uncle's; and was determined
 next Tuesday to set out thither himself with my mother; and that (for
 it was to no purpose to conceal a resolution so soon to be put into
 execution)--I must not dispute it any longer--on Wednesday I must give
 my hand--as they would have me.
 She proceeded, that orders were already given for a license: that the
 ceremony was to be performed in my own chamber, in presence of all my
 friends, except of my father and mother; who would not return, nor see
 me, till all was over, and till they had a good account of my behaviour.
 The very intelligence, my dear!--the very intelligence this, which
 Lovelace gave me!
 I was still dumb--only sighing, as if my heart would break.
