that this must have been the case of many a sneaking varlet; because I,
 who know the female world as well as any man in it of my standing, am so
 frequently in doubt of myself, and know not what to make of the matter.
 Then these little sly rogues, how they lie couchant, ready to spring upon
 us harmless fellows the moment we are in their reach!--When the ice is

 It shall be my constant prayer, that all the felicities which this world
 can afford may be your's: and that the Almighty will never suffer you nor
