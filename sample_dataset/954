go abroad, at least in compliment to one another; which shews, that
 each thinks the other does. Robin is your servant and mine, and nobody's
 else--and the day is all my own.
 I must begin with blaming you, my dear, for your resolution not to
 litigate for your right, if occasion were to be given you. Justice is
 due to ourselves, as well as to every body else. Still more must I blame
 you for declaring to your aunt and sister, that you will not: since (as
 they will tell it to your father and brother) the declaration must needs
 give advantage to spirits who have so little of that generosity for
 which you are so much distinguished.
 There never was a spirit in the world that would insult where it dared,
 but it would creep and cringe where it dared not. Let me remind you of
 a sentence of your own, the occasion for which I have forgotten: 'That
 little spirits will always accommodate themselves to the temper of those
 they would work upon: will fawn upon a sturdy-tempered person: will
 insult the meek:'--And another given to Miss Biddulph, upon an occasion
 you cannot forget:--'If we assume a dignity in what we say and do, and
 take care not to disgrace by arrogance our own assumption, every body
 will treat us with respect and deference.'
 I remember that you once made an observation, which you said, you was
 obliged to Mrs. Norton for, and she to her father, upon an excellent
 preacher, who was but an indifferent liver: 'That to excel in theory,
 and to excel in practice, generally required different talents; which
 did not always meet in the same person.' Do you, my dear (to whom theory
 and practice are the same thing in almost every laudable quality), apply
 the observation to yourself, in this particular case, where resolution
 is required; and where the performance of the will of the defunct is the
 question--no more to be dispensed with by you, in whose favour it was
 made, than by any body else who have only themselves in view by breaking
 through it.
