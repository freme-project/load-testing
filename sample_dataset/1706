 Nor was my Rosebud the only girl I spared:--When my power was
 acknowledged, who more merciful than thy friend?
       It is resistance that inflames desire,
       Sharpens the darts of love, and blows its fire.
       Love is disarm'd that meets with too much ease;
       He languishes, and does not care to please.

 I cannot miss a day without making thee uneasy.  Thy conscience, 'tis
