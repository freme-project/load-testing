I am a man of honour; and that my alliance will do credit to the family;
 and after prejudices are overcome, every body will think so; or he would
 not for the world act the part he does.
 There never was a rogue, who had not a salvo to himself for being
 so.--What a praise to honesty, that every man pretends to it, even at
 the instant that he knows he is pursuing the methods that will perhaps
 prove him a knave to the whole world, as well as to his own conscience!
 But what this stupid family can mean, to make all this necessary, I
 cannot imagine. My REVENGE and my LOVE are uppermost by turns. If
 the latter succeed not, the gratifying of the former will be my only
 consolation: and, by all that's good, they shall feel it; although for
 it I become an exile from my native country for ever.
 I will throw myself into my charmer's presence. I have twice already
 attempted it in vain. I shall then see what I may depend upon from her
 favour. If I thought I had no prospect of that, I should be tempted to
 carry her off. That would be a rape worthy of Jupiter!
 But all gentle shall be my movements: all respectful, even to reverence,
 my address to her--her hand shall be the only witness to the pressure
 of my lip--my trembling lip: I know it will tremble, if I do not bid
 it tremble. As soft my sighs, as the sighs of my gentle Rose-bud. By my
 humility will I invite her confidence: the loneliness of the place shall
 give me no advantage: to dissipate her fears, and engage her reliance
 upon my honour for the future, shall be my whole endeavour: but
 little will I complain of, not at all will I threaten, those who are
 continually threatening me: but yet with a view to act the part of
 Dryden's lion; to secure my love, or to let loose my vengeance upon my
 hunters.
  What tho' his mighty soul his grief contains?
  He meditates revenge who least complains:
  And like a lion slumb'ring in his way,
