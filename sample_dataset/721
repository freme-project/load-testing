should not presume to begin the world with.
 But this it seems is the only method that can be taken to disappoint Mr.
 Lovelace; and at the same time to answer all my relations have wish for
 each of us. And surely I will not stand against such an accession to the
 family as may happen from marrying Mr. Solmes: since now a possibility
 is discovered, (which such a grasping mind as my brother's can easily
 turn into a probability,) that my grandfather's estate will revert to
 it, with a much more considerable one of the man's own. Instances of
 estates falling in, in cases far more unlikely than this, are insisted
 upon; and my sister says, in the words of an old saw, It is good to be
 related to an estate.
 While Solmes, smiling no doubt to himself at a hope so remote, by offers
 only, obtains all their interests; and doubts not to join to his own
 the estate I am envied for; which, for the conveniency of its situation
 between two of his, will it seems be of twice the value to him that
 it would be of to any other person; and is therefore, I doubt not, a
 stronger motive with him than the wife.
 These, my dear, seem to me the principal inducements of my relations to
 espouse so vehemently as they do this man's suit. And here, once more,
 must I deplore the family fault, which gives those inducements such a
 force as it will be difficult to resist.
 And thus far, let matters with regard to Mr. Solmes and me come out as
 they will, my brother has succeeded in his views; that is to say, he
 has, in the first place, got my FATHER to make the cause his own, and to
 insist upon my compliance as an act of duty.
 My MOTHER has never thought fit to oppose my father's will, when once he
 has declared himself determined.
 My UNCLES, stiff, unbroken, highly-prosperous bachelors, give me leave
 to say, (though very worthy persons in the main,) have as high notions
 of a child's duty, as of a wife's obedience; in the last of which, my
