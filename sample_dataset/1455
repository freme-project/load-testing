LETTER XLIII
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]
 And now, my dear, a few words, as to the prohibition laid upon you; a

 besides that this helps to form one to a style, and opens and expands
 the ductile mind, every one will find that many a good thought
 evaporates in thinking; many a good resolution goes off, driven out of
 memory perhaps by some other not so good. But when I set down what I
