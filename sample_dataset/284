"None."
 "One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
 "She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
 again."
 "And your father? Did you tell him?"
 "Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
 happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,
 what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
 the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my
 money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,
 there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about
 money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
 could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me
 half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
 pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
 heavily into it.
 "I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and
 I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the
 weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
 dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel
 vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
 "Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
 "I fear not."
 "Then what has happened to him?"
 "You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
 accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
 spare."
 "I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.
 "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
 "Thank you. And your address?"
