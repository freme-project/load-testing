him; that she did say--
 But I asked him, if he had any news by his last letters from London?--A
 question which he always understands to be a subject changer; for
 otherwise I never put it. And so if he be but silent, I am not angry
 with him that he answers it not.
 I choose not to mention my proposal before him, till I know how it will
 be relished by my mother. If it be not well received, perhaps I may

 make it better for the servants according to their merits--how it made
 the man stare!--And it may be his ruin too, as far as I know. If he
 should buy a ring, and marry a sorry body in the neighbourhood with the
