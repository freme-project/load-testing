 relations.
 If you will not, for your duty's sake, forbear your tauntings and
 impatience, let me beseech you, that you will for mine.--Since

 I enclose the copy of my letter to my sister, which you are desirous to
 see. You will observe, that although I have not demanded my estate in
 form, and of my trustees, yet that I have hinted at leave to retire to
 it. How joyfully would I keep my word, if they would accept of the offer
 I renew!--It was not proper, I believe you will think, on many accounts,
 to own that I was carried off against my inclination. I am, my dearest
 friend,
 Your ever obliged and affectionate, CL. HARLOWE.

 sacrifice to a man I could not bear to think of. But what is done, is

 relenting of my dear and honourable parents.--Yet this from no other
 motives but those of duty to them.--To whom I am ready to return (if
 I may not be permitted to retire to The Grove) on conditions which I
 before offered to comply with.
 Nor shall I be in any sort of dependence upon the person by whose means
