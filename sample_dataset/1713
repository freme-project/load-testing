 While a husband has this security from legal sanctions, that if his wife
 be detected in a criminal conversation with a man of fortune, (the most
 likely by bribes to seduce her,) he may recover very great damages, and
 procure a divorce besides: which, to say nothing of the ignominy, is a
 consideration that must have some force upon both parties.  And a wife

 But there are difficulties in procuring a divorce--[and so there ought]--
 and none, says the rake, in parting with a mistress whenever you suspect

 novelty?
 But I don't see, if we judge by fact, and by the practice of all we have
 been acquainted with of the keeping-class, that we know how to part with
 them when we have them.
 That we know we can if we will, is all we have for it: and this leads us
 to bear many things from a mistress, which we would not from a wife.

 art is so necessary?] if you have given her the credit of being called by
 your name: if you have a settled place of abode, and have received and
 paid visits in her company, as your wife: if she has brought you children
 --you will allow that these are strong obligations upon you in the
