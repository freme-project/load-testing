is the less wonder, then, raw from the college, so lately himself the
 tutored, that he should set up for a tutor, a prescriber to our
 gentler sex, whose tastes and manners are differently formed: for what,
 according to his account, are colleges, but classes of tyrants, from
 the upper students over the lower, and from them to the tutor?--That he,
 with such masculine passions should endeavour to controul and bear down

 a man I cannot endure? If I have not been used to oppose the will of
 my father, but have always delighted to oblige and obey, judge of the
 strength of my antipathy, by the painful opposition I am obliged to
