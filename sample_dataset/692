distinguish away my duty: repeating, that he would be obeyed.
 My heart is too full;--so full, that it may endanger my duty, were I
 to try to unburden it to you on this occasion: so I will lay down my
 pen.--But can--Yet positively, I will lay down my pen--!
 LETTER IX
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FEB. 26, IN THE MORNING.
 My aunt, who staid here last night, made me a visit this morning as
 soon as it was light. She tells me, that I was left alone with my
 father yesterday on purpose that he might talk with me on my expected
 obedience; but that he owned he was put beside his purpose by reflecting
 on something my brother had told him in my disfavour, and by his
 impatience but to suppose, that such a gentle spirit as mine had
 hitherto seemed to be, should presume to dispute his will in a point
 where the advantage of the whole family was to be so greatly promoted by
 my compliance.
 I find, by a few words which dropt unawares from my aunt, that they have
 all an absolute dependence upon what they suppose to be meekness in my
 temper. But in this they may be mistaken; for I verily think, upon a
 strict examination of myself, that I have almost as much in me of my
 father's as of my mother's family.
 My uncle Harlowe it seems is against driving me upon extremities: But
 my brother has engaged, that the regard I have for my reputation, and
 my principles, will bring me round to my duty; that's the expression.
 Perhaps I shall have reason to wish I had not known this.
 My aunt advises me to submit for the present to the interdicts they
 have laid me under; and indeed to encourage Mr. Solmes's address. I have
 absolutely refused the latter, let what will (as I have told her) be the
 consequence. The visiting prohibition I will conform to. But as to that
 of not corresponding with you, nothing but the menace that our letters
 shall be intercepted, can engage my observation of it.
