Now to my closet retired I; then quitting it, threw myself upon the
 settee; then upon this chair, then upon that; then into one window, then
 into another--I knew not what to do!--And while I was in this suspense,
 having again taken up the letter to re-peruse it, Betty came in,
 reminding me, by order, that my papa and mamma waited for me in my
 father's study.
 Tell my mamma, said I, that I beg the favour of seeing her here for one
 moment, or to permit me to attend her any where by herself.
 I listened at the stairs-head--You see, my dear, how it is, cried
 my father, very angrily: all your condescension (as your indulgence
 heretofore) is thrown away. You blame your son's violence, as you call
 it [I had some pleasure in hearing this]; but nothing else will do with
 her. You shall not see her alone. Is my presence an exception to the
 bold creature?
 Tell her, said my mother to Betty, she knows upon what terms she may
 come down to us. Nor will I see her upon any other.
 The maid brought me this answer. I had recourse to my pen and ink; but
 I trembled so, that I could not write, nor knew what to say, had I
 steadier fingers. At last Betty brought me these lines from my father.
 UNDUTIFUL AND PERVERSE CLARISSA,
 No condescension, I see, will move you. Your mother shall not see you;
 nor will I. Prepare however to obey. You know our pleasure. Your uncle
 Antony, your brother, and your sister, and your favourite Mrs. Norton,
 shall see the ceremony performed privately at your uncle's chapel. And
 when Mr. Solmes can introduce you to us, in the temper we wish to behold
 you in, we may perhaps forgive his wife, although we never can, in
 any other character, our perverse daughter. As it will be so privately
 performed, clothes and equipage may be provided for afterwards. So
 prepare to go to your uncle's for an early day in next week. We will not
 see you till all is over: and we will have it over the sooner, in order
