fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
 at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
 his wife has ceased to love him."
 "My dear Holmes!"
 "He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he
 continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a
 sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
 middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
 last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are
 the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,
 by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
 on in his house."
 "You are certainly joking, Holmes."
 "Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
 these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
 "I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I
 am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
 this man was intellectual?"
 For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
 over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is
 a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a
 brain must have something in it."
 "The decline of his fortunes, then?"
 "This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge
 came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the
 band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
 afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no
 hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
 "Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the
 foresight and the moral retrogression?"
