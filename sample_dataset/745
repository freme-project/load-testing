well: but you have had no trials till now: and I hope, that now you are
 called to one, you will not fail in it. Parents, proceeded she, when
 children are young, are pleased with every thing they do. You have been
 a good child upon the whole: but we have hitherto rather complied with
 you, than you with us. Now that you are grown up to marriageable years,
 is the test; especially as your grandfather has made you independent, as
 we may say, in preference to those who had prior expectations upon that
 estate.
 Madam, my grandfather knew, and expressly mentioned in his will his
 desire, that my father will more than make it up to my sister. I did
 nothing but what I thought my duty to procure his favour. It was rather
 a mark of his affection, than any advantage to me: For, do I either
 seek or wish to be independent? Were I to be queen of the universe, that
 dignity should not absolve me from my duty to you and to my father. I
 would kneel for your blessings, were it in the presence of millions--so
 that--
 I am loth to interrupt you, Clary; though you could more than once break
 in upon me. You are young and unbroken: but, with all this ostentation
 of your duty, I desire you to shew a little more deference to me when I
 am speaking.
 I beg your pardon, dear Madam, and your patience with me on such an
 occasion as this. If I did not speak with earnestness upon it, I should
 be supposed to have only maidenly objections against a man I never can
 endure.
 Clary Harlowe--!
 Dearest, dearest Madam, permit me to speak what I have to say, this
 once--It is hard, it is very hard, to be forbidden to enter into
 the cause of all these misunderstandings, because I must not speak
 disrespectfully of one who supposes me in the way of his ambition, and
 treats me like a slave--
