indeed I am not. On the contrary, I give you my hearty thanks for your
 friendly premonitions; and I charge you (as I have often done) that if
 you observe any thing in me so very faulty as would require from you
 to others in my behalf the palliation of friendly and partial love, you
 acquaint me with it: for methinks I would so conduct myself as not to
 give reason even for an adversary to censure me; and how shall so weak
 and so young a creature avoid the censure of such, if my friend will not
 hold a looking-glass before me to let me see my imperfections?
 Judge me, then, my dear, as any indifferent person (knowing what you
 know of me) would do. I may be at first be a little pained; may glow a
 little perhaps to be found less worthy of your friendship than I wish
 to be; but assure yourself, that your kind correction will give me
 reflection that shall amend me. If it do not, you will have a fault to
 accuse me of, that will be utterly inexcusable: a fault, let me add,
 that should you not accuse me of it (if in your opinion I am guilty) you
 will not be so much, so warmly, my friend as I am yours; since I have
 never spared you on the like occasions.
 Here I break off to begin another letter to you, with the assurance,
 mean time, that I am, and ever will be,
 Your equally affectionate and grateful, CL. HARLOWE.
 LETTER XII
 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING, MARCH 2.
 Indeed you would not be in love with him for the world!--Your servant,
 my dear. Nor would I have you. For, I think, with all the advantages of
 person, fortune, and family, he is not by any means worthy of you. And
 this opinion I give as well from the reasons you mention (which I cannot
 but confirm) as from what I have heard of him but a few hours ago
 from Mrs. Fortescue, a favourite of Lady Betty Lawrance, who knows him
 well--but let me congratulate you, however, on your being the first of
 our sex that ever I heard of, who has been able to turn that lion, Love,
