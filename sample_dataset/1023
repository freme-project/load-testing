 I am reddie to make oathe, that every tittle is true: and you will
 see what a man you are sed to favour. But I hope not so, for your owne
 honour.
 Pray, Madam, vouchsafe me a hearing, as you valew your honour and

 Your most humble and most faithful servant, ROGER SOLMES.
 I wait below for the hope of admittance.

 I have no manner of doubt, that this is a poor device to get this man
 into my company. I would have sent down a verbal answer; but Betty
 refused to carry any message, which should prohibit his visiting me. So
 I was obliged either to see him, or to write to him. I wrote therefore
 an answer, of which I shall send you the rough draught. And now my heart
 aches for what may follow from it; for I hear a great hurry below.

 TO ROGER SOLMES, ESQ.
 SIR,
 Whatever you have to communicate to me, which concerns my honour, may as
 well be done by writing as by word of mouth. If Mr. Lovelace is any
 of my concern, I know not that therefore he ought to be yours: for the
 usage I receive on your account [I must think it so!] is so harsh, that
 were there not such a man in the world as Mr. Lovelace, I would not wish
 to see Mr. Solmes, no, not for one half-hour, in the way he is pleased
 to be desirous to see me. I never can be in any danger from Mr.
 Lovelace, (and, of consequence, cannot be affected by any of your
 discoveries,) if the proposal I made be accepted. You have been
 acquainted with it no doubt. If not, be pleased to let my friends know,
 that if they will rid me of my apprehensions of one gentleman, I will
 rid them of their of another: And then, of what consequence to them, or
