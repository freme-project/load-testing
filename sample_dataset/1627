Now, my dear, she says, I cannot bear the life I live.  I would be glad
 at my heart to be out of his reach.  If I were, he should soon find the
 difference.  If I must be humbled, it had better be by those to whom I
 owe duty, than by him.  My aunt writes in her letter,* that SHE dare not
 propose any thing in my favour.  You tell me, that upon inquiry, you
 find,* that, had I not been unhappily seduced away, a change of measures
 was actually resolved upon; and that my mother, particularly, was
 determined to exert herself for the restoration of the family peace; and,
 in order to succeed the better, had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle
 Harlowe in her party.
 * See Vol. III. Letter LII.
 ** Ibid. Letter VIII.
 Let me build on these foundations.  I can but try, my dear.  It is my
 duty to try all probable methods to restore the poor outcast to favour.
 And who knows but that once indulgent uncle, who has very great weight in
 the family, may be induced to interpose in my behalf?  I will give up all
 right and title to my grandfather's devises and bequests, with all my
 heart and soul, to whom they please, in order to make my proposal
 palatable to my brother.  And that my surrender may be effectual, I will
 engage never to marry.
 What think you, my dear, of this expedient?  Surely, they cannot resolve
 to renounce me for ever.  If they look with impartial eyes upon what has
 happened, they will have something to blame themselves for, as well as
 I presume, that you will be of opinion that this expedient is worth
 trying.  But here is my difficulty: If I should write, my hard-hearted
 brother has so strongly confederated them all against me, that my letter
 would be handed about from one to another, till he had hardened every one
 to refuse my request; whereas could my uncle be engaged to espouse my
 cause, as from himself, I should have some hope, as I presume to think he
 would soon have my mother and my aunt of his party.
