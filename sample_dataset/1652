desired leave to attend me.
 Mrs. Sinclair came out at that instant, and asked me, if I did not choose
 a dish of chocolate?
 I wish, Mrs. Sinclair, said I, you would take this man in with you to
 your chocolate.  I don't know whether I am at liberty to stir out without
 his leave or not.
 Then turning to him, I asked, if he kept me there his prisoner?
 Dorcas just then bringing him his sword and hat, he opened the street-
 door, and taking my reluctant hand, led me, in a very obsequious manner,
 to the coach.  People passing by, stopped, stared, and whispered--But he
 is so graceful in his person and dress, that he generally takes every
 eye.
 I was uneasy to be so gazed at; and he stepped in after me, and the
 coachman drove to St. Paul's.
 He was very full of assiduities all the way; while I was as reserved as
 possible: and when I returned, dined, as I had done the greatest part of
 the week, by myself.
 He told me, upon my resolving to do so, that although he would continue
 his passive observance till I knew the issue of my application, yet I
 must expect, that then I should not rest one moment till I had fixed his
 happy day: for that his very soul was fretted with my slights,
 resentments, and delays.
 A wretch! when can I say, to my infinite regret, on a double account,
 that all he complains of is owing to himself!
 O that I may have good tidings from my uncle!
 Adieu, my dearest friend--This shall lie ready for an exchange (as I hope
 for one to-morrow from you) that will decide, as I may say, the destiny
 Your
 CLARISSA HARLOWE.
