name I might now have been called? For how should I have resisted a
 condescending, a kneeling father, had he been able to have kept his
 temper with me?
 Yet my aunt say he would have relented, if I had not. Perhaps he would
 have been moved by my humility, before he could have shown such undue
 condescension. Such temper as he would have received me with might have
 been improved upon in my favour. And that he had designed ultimately to
 relent, how it clears my friends (at least to themselves) and condemns
 me! O why were my aunt's hints (I remember them now) so very dark?--Yet
 I intended to have returned after the interview; and then perhaps
 she would have explained herself.--O this artful, this designing
 Lovelace--yet I must repeat, that most ought I to blame myself for
 meeting him.
 But far, far, be banished from me fruitless recrimination! Far banished,
 because fruitless! Let me wrap myself about in the mantle of my own
 integrity, and take comfort in my unfaulty intention! Since it is now
 too late to look back, let me collect all my fortitude, and endeavour to
 stand those shafts of angry Providence, which it will not permit me to
 shun! That, whatever the trials may be which I am destined to undergo, I
 may not behave unworthily in them, and may come out amended by them.
 Join with me in this prayer, my beloved friend; for your own honour's
 sake, as well as for love's sake, join with me in it; lest a deviation
 on my side should, with the censorious, cast a shade upon a friendship
 which has no levity in it; and the basis of which is improvement, as
 well in the greater as lesser duties.
 CL. HARLOWE.
