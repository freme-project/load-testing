professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police
 regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some
 little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand
 side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the
 wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
 cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he
 is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
 greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I
 have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of
 making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised
 at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His
 appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him
 without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face
 disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
 turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a
 pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular
 contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid
 the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he
 is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
 thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now
 learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been
 the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
 "But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed
 against a man in the prime of life?"
 "He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in
 other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
 Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that
 weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
 strength in the others."
 "Pray continue your narrative."
