She went on, comforting me, as she thought. 'She laid before me the
 merit of obedience; and told me, that if it were my desire that my
 Norton should be present at the ceremony, it would be complied with:
 that the pleasure I should receive from reconciling al my friends to me,
 and in their congratulations upon it, must needs overbalance, with such
 a one as me, the difference of persons, however preferable I might think
 the one man to the other: that love was a fleeting thing, little better
 than a name, where mortality and virtue did not distinguish the object
 of it: that a choice made by its dictates was seldom happy; at least not
 durably so: nor was it to be wondered at, when it naturally exalted the
 object above its merits, and made the lover blind to faults, that were
 visible to every body else: so that when a nearer intimacy stript it of
 its imaginary perfections, it left frequently both parties surprised,
 that they could be so grossly cheated; and that then the indifference
 became stronger than the love ever was. That a woman gave a man great
 advantages, and inspired him with great vanity, when she avowed her
 love for him, and preference of him; and was generally requited with
 insolence and contempt: whereas the confessedly-obliged man, it was
 probable, would be all reverence and gratitude'--and I cannot tell what.
 'You, my dear, said she, believe you shall be unhappy, if you have
 Mr. Solmes: your parents think the contrary; and that you will be
 undoubtedly so, were you to have Mr. Lovelace, whose morals are
 unquestionably bad: suppose it were your sad lot to consider, what
 great consolation you will have on one hand, if you pursue your parents'
 advice, that you did so; what mortification on the other, that by
 following your own, you have nobody to blame but yourself.'
 This, you remember, my dear, was an argument enforced upon me by Mrs.
 Norton.
 These and other observations which she made were worthy of my aunt
 Hervey's good sense and experience, and applied to almost any young
