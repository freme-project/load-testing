But let this be as it will, shall I tell you, how, after all his
 offences, he may creep in with you again?
 I will. Thus then: It is but to claim for himself the good-natured
 character: and this, granted, will blot out the fault of passionate
 insolence: and so he will have nothing to do, but this hour to
 accustom you to insult; the next, to bring you to forgive him, upon
 his submission: the consequence must be, that he will, by this teazing,
 break your resentment all to pieces: and then, a little more of the
 insult, and a little less of the submission, on his part, will go down,
 till nothing else but the first will be seen, and not a bit of the
 second. You will then be afraid to provoke so offensive a spirit: and
 at last will be brought so prettily, and so audibly, to pronounce the
 little reptile word OBEY, that it will do one's heart good to hear you.
 The Muscovite wife then takes place of the managed mistress. And if
 you doubt the progression, be pleased, my dear, to take your mother's
 judgment upon it.
 But no more of this just now. Your situation is become too critical to
 permit me to dwell upon these sort of topics. And yet this is but an
 affected levity with me. My heart, as I have heretofore said, is a
 sincere sharer in all your distresses. My sun-shine darts but through
 a drizly cloud. My eye, were you to see it, when it seems to you so
 gladdened, as you mentioned in a former, is more than ready to overflow,
 even at the very passages perhaps upon which you impute to me the
 archness of exultation.
 But now the unheard-of cruelty and perverseness of some of your friends
 [relations, I should say--I am always blundering thus!] the as strange
 determinedness of others; your present quarrel with Lovelace; and your
 approaching interview with Solmes, from which you are right to apprehend
 a great deal; are such considerable circumstances in your story, that it
 is fit they should engross all my attention.
