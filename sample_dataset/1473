she was flying from me, and kneeling at her fee, O my angel, said I,
 (quite destitute of reserve, and hardly knowing the tenor of my own
 speech; and had a parson been there, I had certainly been a gone man,)
 receive the vows of your faithful Lovelace. Make him yours, and only
 yours, for ever. This will answer every end. Who will dare to form plots
 and stratagems against my wife? That you are not so is the ground of
 all their foolish attempts, and of their insolent hopes in Solmes's
 favour.--O be mine!--I beseech you (thus on my knee I beseech you) to
 be mine. We shall then have all the world with us. And every body will
 applaud an event that every body expects.
 Was the devil in me! I no more intended all this ecstatic nonsense, than
 I thought the same moment of flying in the air! All power is with this
 charming creature. It is I, not she, at this rate, that must fail in the
 arduous trial.
 Didst thou ever before hear of a man uttering solemn things by an
 involuntary impulse, in defiance of premeditation, and of all his proud
 schemes? But this sweet creature is able to make a man forego every
 purpose of his heart that is not favourable to her. And I verily think
 I should be inclined to spare her all further trial (and yet what trial
 has she had?) were it not for the contention that her vigilance has set
 on foot, which shall overcome the other. Thou knowest my generosity
 to my uncontending Rosebud--and sometimes do I qualify my
 ardent aspirations after even this very fine creature, by this
 reflection:--That the most charming woman on earth, were she an empress,
 can excel the meanest in the customary visibles only. Such is the
 equality of the dispensation, to the prince and the peasant, in this
 prime gift WOMAN.
 Well, but what was the result of this involuntary impulse on my
 part?--Wouldst thou not think; I was taken at my offer?--An offer so
 solemnly made, and on one knee too?
