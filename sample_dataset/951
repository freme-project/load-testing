 than familiars to him. You, I know, lay this to his fearfulness of
 disobliging or offending. Indeed your over-doers generally give the
 offence they endeavour to avoid.
 The man however is honest: is of family: has a clear and good estate;
 and may one day be a baronet, an't please you. He is humane and

 should shew the ardour of their passion, rather than the sheepishness
 of their nature; for who knows not that love delights in taming the
