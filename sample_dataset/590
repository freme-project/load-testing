"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
 points to suicide?"
 
 "No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
 solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of
 your troubles."
 
 "Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have
 learned something! Where are the gems?"
 
 "You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for
 them?"
 
 "I would pay ten."
 
 "That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.
 And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
 Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."
 
 With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
 walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
 gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
 
 With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
 
 "You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
 
 The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
 he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
