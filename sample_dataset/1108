from my family: he cannot charge himself to be of a temper that leads
 him to be inquisitive into any body's private affairs; but hopes, that
 the circumstances of the case, and the strange conduct of my friends,
 will excuse him; especially when so much depends upon his knowing the
 movements of a family so violently bent, by measures right or wrong, to
 carry their point against me, in malice to him. People, he says, who act
 like angels, ought to have angels to deal with. For his part, he has not
 yet learned the difficult lesson of returning good for evil: and shall
 think himself the less encouraged to learn it by the treatment I have
 met with from the very persons who would trample upon him, as they do
 upon me, were he to lay himself under their feet.
 'He excuses himself for the liberties he owns he has heretofore taken in
 ridiculing the marriage-state. It is a subject, he says, that he has not
 of late treated so lightly. He owns it to be so trite, so beaten a
 topic with all libertines and witlings; so frothy, so empty, so nothing
 meaning, so worn-out a theme, that he is heartily ashamed of himself,
 ever to have made it his. He condemns it as a stupid reflection upon the
 laws and good order of society, and upon a man's own ancestors: and
 in himself, who has some reason to value himself upon his descent
 and alliances, more censurable, than in those who have not the same
 advantages to boast of. He promises to be more circumspect than ever,
 both in his words and actions, that he may be more and more worthy of
 my approbation; and that he may give an assurance before hand, that a
 foundation is laid in his mind for my example to work upon with equal
 reputation and effect to us both;--if he may be so happy to call me his.
 'He gives me up, as absolutely lost, if I go to my uncle Antony's; the
 close confinement; the moated house; the chapel; the implacableness of
 my brother and sister; and their power over the rest of the family,
 he sets forth in strong lights; and plainly says, that he must have a
 struggle to prevent my being carried thither.'
