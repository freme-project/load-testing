But I should own, that in the letters he sent me upon the general
 subject, he more than once inclosed a particular one, declaring his
 passionate regards for me, and complaining with fervour enough, of my
 reserves. But of these I took not the least notice: for, as I had not
 written to him at all, but upon a subject so general, I thought it was
 but right to let what he wrote upon one so particular pass off as if I
 had never seen it; and the rather, as I was not then at liberty (from
 the approbation his letters met with) to break off the correspondence,
 unless I had assigned the true reason for doing so. Besides, with all
 his respectful assiduities, it was easy to observe, (if it had not been
 his general character) that his temper is naturally haughty and violent;
 and I had seen too much of that untractable spirit in my brother to like
 it in one who hoped to be still more nearly related to me.
 I had a little specimen of this temper of his upon the very occasion I
 have mentioned: For after he had sent me a third particular letter with
 the general one, he asked me the next time he came to Harlowe-Place,
 if I had not received such a one from him?--I told him I should never
 answer one so sent; and that I had waited for such an occasion as he had
 now given me, to tell him so: I desired him therefore not to write again
 on the subject; assuring him, that if he did, I would return both, and
 never write another line to him.
 You can't imagine how saucily the man looked; as if, in short, he was
 disappointed that he had not made a more sensible impression upon me:
 nor, when he recollected himself (as he did immediately), what a visible
 struggle it cost him to change his haughty airs for more placid ones.
 But I took no notice of either; for I thought it best to convince him,
 by the coolness and indifference with which I repulsed his forward hopes
 (at the same time intending to avoid the affectation of pride or
 vanity) that he was not considerable enough in my eyes to make me take
 over-ready offence at what he said, or at his haughty looks: in other
