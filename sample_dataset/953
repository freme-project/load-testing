 Hickman, a great overgrown, lank-haired, chubby boy, who would be
 hunched and punched by every body; and go home with his finger in his
 eye, and tell his mother.
 While Lovelace I have supposed a curl-pated villain, full of fire,
 fancy, and mischief; an orchard-robber, a wall-climber, a horse-rider
 without saddle or bridle, neck or nothing: a sturdy rogue, in short,
 who would kick and cuff, and do no right, and take no wrong of any

 of itself; while he went on to do more mischief, and if not to get,
 to deserve, broken bones. And the same dispositions have grown up with
 them, and distinguish them as me, with no very material alteration.
 Only that all men are monkeys more or less, or else that you and I
 should have such baboons as these to choose out of, is a mortifying
 thing, my dear.
 I am sensible that I am a little out of season in treating thus
 ludicrously the subject I am upon, while you are so unhappy; and if
 my manner does not divert you, as my flightiness used to do, I am
 inexcusable both to you, and to my own heart: which, I do assure you,
 notwithstanding my seeming levity, is wholly in your case.
 As this letter is extremely whimsical, I will not send it until I can
 accompany it with something more solid and better suited to your
 unhappy circumstances; that is to say, to the present subject of our
 correspondence. To-morrow, as I told you, will be wholly my own, and of
 consequence yours. Adieu, therefore, till then.
