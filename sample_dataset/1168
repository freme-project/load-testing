it, that it is your duty to comply. She says, she was always of opinion
 that daughters should implicitly submit to the will of their parents in
 the great article of marriage; and that she governed herself accordingly
 in marrying my father; who at first was more the choice of her parents
 than her own.
 This is what she argues in behalf of her favourite Hickman, as well as
 for Solmes in your case.
 I must not doubt, but my mother always governed herself by this
 principle--because she says she did. I have likewise another reason to
 believe it; which you shall have, though it may not become me to give
 it--that they did not live so happily together, as one would hope people
 might do who married preferring each other at the time to the rest of
 the world.
 Somebody shall fare never the better for this double-meant policy of my
 mother, I do assure you. Such a retrospection in her arguments to
 him, and to his address, it is but fit that he should suffer for my
 mortification in failing to carry a point upon which I had set my whole
 heart.
 Think, my dear, if in any way I can serve you. If you allow of it,
 I protest I will go off privately with you, and we will live and die
 together. Think of it. Improve upon my hint, and command me.
 A little interruption.--What is breakfast to the subject I am upon?

 London, I am told, is the best hiding-place in the world. I have written
 nothing but what I will stand in to at the word of command. Women love
 to engage in knight-errantry, now-and-then, as well as to encourage
 it in the men. But in your case, what I propose will not seem to have
 anything of that nature in it. It will enable me to perform what is no
 more than a duty in serving and comforting a dear and worthy friend, who
 labours under undeserved oppression: and you will ennoble, as I may say,
