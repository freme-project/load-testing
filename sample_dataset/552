"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
 Have you good authority for what you say?"
 
 "The best possible."
 
 Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
 forehead.
 
 "What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of
 the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
 
 "It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any

 "I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the
 lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of
 doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she
 had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
 
 "It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,
 tapping his fingers upon the table.
 
 "You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so
 unprecedented a position."
 
 "I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have
 been shamefully used."
