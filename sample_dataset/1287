Lovelace the corrupting of a servant of my father's; and now I am glad
 to give a kind of indirect approbation of that fault, by inquiring of
 him what he hears, by that or any other way, of the manner in which my
 relations took my flight. A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight, it
 must undoubtedly appear to them. How grievous is that to think of! yet
 how, as long as I am situated, can I put them right?
 Most heavily, he says, they take it; but shew not so much grief as rage.
 And he can hardly have patience to hear of the virulence and menaces
 of my brother against himself. Then a merit is made to me of his
 forbearance.
 What a satisfaction am I robbed of, my dearest friend, when I reflect
 upon my inconsiderateness! O that I had it still in my power to say I
 suffered wrong, rather than did wrong! That others were more wanting in
 their kindness to me than I duty (where duty is owing) to them.
 Fie upon me! for meeting the seducer!--Let all end as happily as it now
 may, I have laid up for myself remorse for my whole life.
 What still more concerns me is, that every time I see this man, I am
 still at a greater loss than before what to make of him. I watch every
 turn of his countenance: and I think I see very deep lines in it. He
 looks with more meaning, I verily think, than he used to look; yet not
 more serious; not less gay--I don't know how he looks--but with more
 confidence a great deal than formerly; and yet he never wanted that.
 But here is the thing; I behold him with fear now, as conscious of the
 power my indiscretion has given him over me. And well may he look more
 elate, when he sees me deprived of all the self-supposed significance,
 which adorns and exalts a person who has been accustomed to respect; and
 who now, by a conscious inferiority, allows herself to be overcome,
 and in a state of obligation, as I may say, to a man who from a humble
 suitor to her for her favour, assumes the consequence and airs of a
 protector.
