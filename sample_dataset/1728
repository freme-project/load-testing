unguarded, precipitate, and thoughtless, the same quickness,
 changeableness, and suddenness of spirit, as I may call it, may intervene
 (if the heart be not corrupted) to recover them to thought and duty.
 His reason for declining to go in person to bring up the ladies of his
 family, while my brother and Singleton continue their machinations,
 carries no bad face with it; and one may the rather allow for their
 expectations, that so proud a spirit as his should attend them for this
 purpose, as he speaks of them sometimes as persons of punctilio.

 His cautions to the servants about the sailor, if he should come and make

 I cannot but acknowledge that I am pleased to find that he has actually
 written to Lord M.
