could sooner die than contradict it.  And still he insisted upon the
 propriety of appearing to be married, for the reasons he had given
 before--And, dearest creature, said he, why this high displeasure with
 me upon so well-intended an expedient?  You know, that I cannot wish to
 shun your brother, or his Singleton, but upon your account.  The first
 step I would take, if left to myself, would be to find them out.  I have
 always acted in this manner, when any body has presumed to give out
 threatenings against it.
 'Tis true I would have consulted you first, and had your leave.  But
 since you dislike what I have said, let me implore you, dearest Madam,
 to give the only proper sanction to it, by naming an early day.  Would to
 Heaven that were to be to-morrow!--For God's sake, let it be to-morrow!
 But, if not, [was it his business, my dear, before I spoke (yet he seemed
 to be afraid of me) to say, if not?] let me beseech you, Madam, if my
 behaviour shall not be to your dislike, that you will not to-morrow, at
 breakfast-time, discredit what I have told them.  The moment I give you
 cause to think that I take any advantage of your concession, that moment
 revoke it, and expose me, as I shall deserve.--And once more, let me
 remind you, that I have no view either to serve or save myself by this
 expedient.  It is only to prevent a probable mischief, for your own
 mind's sake; and for the sake of those who deserve not the least
 consideration from me.
 What could I say?  What could I do?--I verily think, that had he urged me
 again, in a proper manner, I should have consented (little satisfied as I
 am with him) to give him a meeting to-morrow morning at a more solemn
 place than in the parlour below.
 But this I resolve, that he shall not have my consent to stay a night
 under this roof.  He has now given me a stronger reason for this
 determination than I had before.
 Alas! my dear, how vain a thing to say, what we will, or what we will not
