censure of the world.  She must therefore choose to be mine, for the sake
 of soldering up her reputation in the eye of that impudent world.  For,
 who that knows me, and knows that she has been in my power, though but
 for twenty-four hours, will think her spotless as to fact, let her
 inclination be what it will?  And then human nature is such a well-known
 rogue, that every man and woman judges by what each knows of him or
 herself, that inclination is no more to be trusted, where an opportunity
 is given, than I am; especially where a woman, young and blooming, loves
 a man well enough to go off with him; for such will be the world's
 construction in the present case.
 She calls her maid Dorcas.  No doubt, that I may hear her harmonious
 voice, and to give me an opportunity to pour out my soul at her feet; to
 renew all my vows; and to receive her pardon for the past offence: and
 then, with what pleasure shall I begin upon a new score, and afterwards
 wipe out that; and begin another, and another, till the last offence
 passes; and there can be no other!  And once, after that, to be forgiven,
 will be to be forgiven for ever.
 The door is again shut. Dorcas tells me, that her lady denies to admit me
 to dine with her; a favour I had ordered the wench to beseech her to
 grant me, the next time she saw her--not uncivilly, however, denies--
 coming-to by degrees!  Nothing but the last offence, the honest wench
 tells me, in the language of her principals below, will do with her.  The
 last offence is meditating.  Yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays
 me booty.
 But here I conclude; though the tyranness leaves me nothing to do but to
 read, write, and fret.
 Subscription is formal between us.  Besides, I am so much her's, that I
 cannot say how much I am thine or any other person's.
