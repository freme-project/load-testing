given him. The enforcing of that may perhaps come next. But I hope not.
 TUESDAY NIGHT.
 Since I wrote the above, I ventured to send a letter by Shorey to my
 mother. I desired her to give it into her own hand, when nobody was by.
 I shall enclose a copy of it. You will see that I would have it thought,
 that now Hannah is gone, I have no way to correspond out of the house. I
 am far from thinking all I do right. I am afraid this is a little piece
 of art, that is not so. But this is an afterthought. The letter went

 HONOURED MADAM,
 Having acknowledged to you, that I had received letters from Mr.
 Lovelace full of resentment, and that I answered them purely to prevent
 further mischief, and having shewn you copies of my answers, which you
 did not disapprove of, although you thought fit, after you had read
 them, to forbid me any further correspondence with him, I think it my
 duty to acquaint you, that another letter from him has since come to my
 hand, in which he is very earnest with me to permit him to wait on my
 papa, or you, or my two uncles, in a pacific way, accompanied by Lord
 M.: on which I beg your commands.
 I own to you, Madam, that had not the prohibition been renewed, and had
 not Hannah been so suddenly dismissed my service, I should have made
 the less scruple to have written an answer, and to have commanded her
 to convey it to him, with all speed, in order to dissuade him from these
 visits, lest any thing should happen on the occasion that my heart aches
 but to think of.
 And here I cannot but express my grief, that I should have all the
 punishment and all the blame, who, as I have reason to think, have
 prevented great mischief, and have not been the occasion of any. For,
 Madam, could I be supposed to govern the passions of either of the
 gentlemen?--Over the one indeed I have had some little influence,
