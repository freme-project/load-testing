would have you, and signify it to us, we shall not stand with you for a
 week or so.
 Your sightlines of person may perhaps make some think this alliance
 disparaging. But I hope you will not put such a personal value upon
 yourself: if you do, it will indeed be the less wonder that person
 should weigh with you (however weak the consideration!) in another man.
 Thus we parents, in justice, ought to judge: that our two daughters are

 what I have suffered within these few weeks past; nor ever will be able
 to guess, till you come to be in my situation; which is that of a fond
 and indulgent mother, praying night and day, and struggling to preserve,
