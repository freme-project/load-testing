a CLARISSA to be susceptible to provocations which she thinks herself
 highly censurable for being so much moved by?'
 But let us see the dear creature resolved to revoke her promise, yet
 meeting her lover; a bold and intrepid man, who was more than once
 before disappointed by her; and who comes, as she knows, prepared to
 expect the fruits of her appointment, and resolved to carry her off.
 And let us see him actually carrying her off, and having her at

 expect such perfection in a woman!
 Yes, I, may I answer. Was not the great Caesar a great rake as to
