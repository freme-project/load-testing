of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
 while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
 with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
 his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
 the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
 
 "I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said
 he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without
 a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured
 age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,
 Mary, has deserted me."
 
 "Deserted you?"
 
 "Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was
 empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
 her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
 married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
 thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
 in this note:
 
 "'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
 and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
 might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
 mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
 leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
 provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
 be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in
 death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'
