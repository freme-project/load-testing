Such a strange perseverance in a measure so unreasonable!--But my
 brother and sister are continually misrepresenting all I say and do; and
 I am deprived of the opportunity of defending myself!--My sister says,*

 MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, MARCH 22.

 freedom, as you call it. I only wonder at your patience with me; that's
 all. I am sorry I gave you the trouble of so long a letter upon the
