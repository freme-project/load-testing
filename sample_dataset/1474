No such thing! The pretty trifler let me off as easily as I could have
 wished.
 Her brother's project; and to find that there were no hopes of a
 reconciliation for her; and the apprehension she had of the mischiefs
 that might ensue; these, not my offer, nor love of me, were the causes
 to which she ascribed all her sweet confusion--an ascription that is
 high treason against my sovereign pride,--to make marriage with me but
 a second-place refuge; and as good as to tell me that her confusion
 was owing to her concern that there were no hopes that my enemies would
 accept of her intended offer to renounce a man who had ventured his life
 for her, and was still ready to run the same risque in her behalf!
 I re-urged her to make me happy, but I was to be postponed to her cousin
 Morden's arrival. On him are now placed all her hopes.
 I raved; but to no purpose.
 Another letter was to be sent, or had been sent, to her aunt Hervey, to
 which she hoped an answer.
 Yet sometimes I think that fainter and fainter would have been her
 procrastinations, had I been a man of courage--but so fearful was I of
 offending!
 A confounded thing! The man to be so bashful; the woman to want so much
 courting!--How shall two such come together--no kind mediatress in the
 way?
 But I must be contented. 'Tis seldom, however, that a love so ardent as
 mine, meets with a spirit so resigned in the same person. But true love,
 I am now convinced, only wishes: nor has it any active will but that of
 the adored object.
 But, O the charming creature, again of herself to mention London! Had
 Singleton's plot been of my own contriving, a more happy expedient could
 not have been thought of to induce her to resume her purpose of going
 thither; nor can I divine what could be her reason for postponing it.
