Yet, as to this correspondence, What hurt could arise from it, if your
 mother could be prevailed upon to permit it to be continued?--So much
 prudence and discretion as you have; and you, in writing to me, lying
 under no temptation of following so bad an example as I have set--my
 letters too occasionally filled with self-accusation.
 I thank you, my dear, most cordially I thank you, for your kind offers.
 You may be assured, that I will sooner be beholden to you, than to any
 body living. To Mr. Lovelace the last. Do not therefore think, that
 by declining your favours, I have an intention to lay myself under
 obligations to him.
 I am willing to hope (notwithstanding what you write) that my friends
 will send me my little money, together with my clothes. They are too
 considerate, some of them at least, to permit that I should be put to
 such low difficulties. Perhaps, they will not be in haste to oblige me.
 But, if not, I cannot yet want. I believe you think, I must not dispute
 with Mr. Lovelace the expenses of the road and lodgings, till I can get
 a fixed abode. But I hope soon to put an end even to those small sort of
 obligations.
 Small hopes indeed of a reconciliation from your account of my uncle's
 visit to your mother, in order to set her against an almost friendless
 creature whom once he loved! But is it not my duty to try for it?
 Ought I to widen my error by obstinacy and resentment, because of their
 resentment; which must appear reasonable to them, as they suppose my
 flight premeditated; and as they are made to believe, that I am capable
 of triumphing in it, and over them, with the man they hate? When I have
 done all in my power to restore myself to their favour, I shall have the
 less to reproach myself with.
 These considerations make me waver about following your advice, in
 relation to marriage; and the rather, as he is so full of complaisance
 with regard to my former conditions, which he calls my injunctions.
