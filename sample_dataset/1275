frustrated.'
 My present situation, I am sure, thought I, affords a sad evidence of
 this truth!
 I was silent all this time. My blame was indeed turned inward.
 Sometimes, too, I was half-frighted at his audaciousness: at others, had
 the less inclination to interrupt him, being excessively fatigued, and
 my spirits sunk to nothing, with a view even of the best prospects with
 such a man.
 This gave his opportunity to proceed: and that he did; assuming a still
 more serious air.
 'As to what further remained for him to say, in answer to what I had
 said, he hoped I would pardon him; but, upon his soul, he was concerned,
 infinitely concerned, he repeated, (his colour and his voice rising,)
 that it was necessary for him to observe, how much I chose rather to
 have run the risque of being Solmes's wife, than to have it in my power
 to reward a man who, I must forgive him, had been as much insulted on my
 account, as I had been on his--who had watched my commands, and (pardon
 me, Madam) ever changeable motion of your pen, all hours, in all
 weathers, and with a cheerfulness and ardour, that nothing but the most
 faithful and obsequious passion could inspire.'
 I now, my dear, began to revive into a little more warmth of
 attention.--
 'And all, Madam, for what?'--How I stared! for he stopt then a moment
 or two--'Only,' went he on, 'to prevail upon you to free yourself from
 ungenerous and base oppressions'--
 Sir, Sir, indignantly said I--
 'Hear me but out, dearest Madam!--My heart is full--I must speak what
 I have to say--To be told (for your words are yet in my ears, and at my
 heart!) that you would give the world, and all your hopes in it, to have
 been still in your cruel and gloomy father's house'--
