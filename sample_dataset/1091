attracted by the example, has given twenty-five guineas to the father,
 who is poor, towards clothes to equip the pretty rustic.
 Mr. Lovelace and his friend, the poor man says, when they first came to
 his house, affected to appear as persons of low degree; but now he knows
 the one (but mentioned it in confidence) to be Colonel Barrow, the other
 Captain Sloane. The colonel he owns was at first very sweet upon his
 girl: but her grandmother's begging of him to spare her innocence, he
 vowed, that he never would offer any thing but good counsel to her. He
 kept his word; and the pretty fool acknowledged, that she never
 could have been better instructed by the minister himself from the
 bible-book!--The girl pleased me so well, that I made her visit to me
 worth her while.
 But what, my dear, will become of us now?--Lovelace not only reformed,
 but turned preacher!--What will become of us now?--Why, my sweet friend,
 your generosity is now engaged in his favour!--Fie upon this generosity!
 I think in my heart, that it does as much mischief to the noble-minded,
 as love to the ignobler.--What before was only a conditional liking, I
 am now afraid will turn to liking unconditional.
 I could not endure to change my invective into panegyric all at once,
 and so soon. We, or such as I at least, love to keep ourselves in
 countenance for a rash judgment, even when we know it to be rash.
 Everybody has not your generosity in confessing a mistake. It requires
 a greatness of soul frankly to do it. So I made still further inquiry
 after his life and manner, and behaviour there, in hopes to find
 something bad: but all uniform!
 Upon the whole, Mr. Lovelace comes out with so much advantage from this
 inquiry, that were there the least room for it, I should suspect the
 whole to be a plot set on foot to wash a blackamoor white. Adieu, my
 dear.
