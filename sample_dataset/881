be worthy of a Clarissa?
 I wish you are not indeed angry with me for harping so much on one
 string. I must own, that I should think myself inexcusable so to do,
 (the rather, as I am bold enough to imagine it a point out of all doubt
 from fifty places in your letters, were I to labour the proof,) if you
 would ingenuously own--
 Own what? you'll say. Why, my Anna Howe, I hope you don't think that I
 am already in love--!
 No, to be sure! How can your Anna Howe have such a thought?--What then
 shall we call it? You might have helped me to a phrase--A conditional
 kind of liking!--that's it.--O my friend! did I not know how much you
 despise prudery; and that you are too young, and too lovely, to be a
 prude--
 But, avoiding such hard names, let me tell you one thing, my dear (which
 nevertheless I have told you before); and that is this: that I shall
 think I have reason to be highly displeased with you, if, when you write
 to me, you endeavour to keep from me any secret of your heart.
 Let me add, that if you would clearly and explicitly tell me, how far
 Lovelace has, or has not, a hold in your affections, I could better
 advise you what to do, than at present I can. You, who are so famed
 for prescience, as I may call it; and than whom no young lady ever had
 stronger pretensions to a share of it; have had, no doubt, reasonings
 in your heart about him, supposing you were to be one day his: [no doubt
 but you have had the same in Solmes's case: whence the ground for the
 hatred of the one; and for the conditional liking of the other.] Will
 you tell me, my dear, what you have thought of Lovelace's best and of
 his worst?--How far eligible for the first; how far rejectable for the
 last?--Then weighing both parts in opposite scales, we shall see which
 is likely to preponderate; or rather which does preponderate. Nothing
 less than the knowledge of the inmost recesses of your heart, can
