she calls her father [her mother had been faultless, had she not been
 her father's wife]; she takes the men she calls her uncles; the fellow

 to be her father, to be her uncles, her brother, her sister; and that,
 as such, she owes to some of them reverence, to others respect, let them
 treat her ever so cruelly!--Sordid ties!--Mere cradle prejudices!--For

 care, O thou most exalted of female minds, and loveliest of persons, how
 thou debasest thyself by encouraging such a competition as thy sordid
