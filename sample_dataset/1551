sent me from any single dish.  But I will not trouble you, my dear, with
 such particulars.
 They thought me very singular; and with reason: but as I liked them not
 so very well as to forego my own choice in compliment to them, I was the
 less concerned for what they thought.--And still the less, as Mr. Lovelace
 had put me very much out of humour with him.
 They, however, cautioned me against melancholy.  I said, I should be a
 very unhappy creature if I could not bear my own company.
 Mr. Lovelace said, that he must let the ladies into my story, and then
 they would know how to allow for my ways.  But, my dear, as you love me,
 said the confident wretch, give as little way to melancholy as possible.
 Nothing but the sweetness of your temper, and your high notions of a duty
 that never can be deserved where you place it, can make you so uneasy as
 you are.--Be not angry, my dear love, for saying so, [seeing me frown, I
 suppose:] and snatched my hand and kissed it.--I left him with them; and
 retired to my closet and my pen.
 Just as I have written thus far, I am interrupted by a message from him,
 that he is setting out on a journey, and desires to take my commands.--So
 here I will leave off, to give him a meeting in the dining-room.
 I was not displeased to see him in his riding-dress.
 He seemed desirous to know how I liked the gentlewomen below.  I told
 him, that although I did not think them very exceptionable; yet as I
 wanted not, in my present situation, new acquaintance, I should not be
 fond of cultivating theirs.
 He urged me still farther on this head.
 I could not say, I told him, that I greatly liked either of the young
 gentlewomen, any more than their aunt: and that, were my situation ever
 so happy, they had much too gay a turn for me.
 He did not wonder, he said, to hear me say so.  He knew not any of the
 sex, who had been accustomed to show themselves at the town diversions
