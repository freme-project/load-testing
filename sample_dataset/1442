as you have, what can you do at such a place as London?--You don't know
 what occasion you may have for messengers, intelligence, and suchlike.
 If you don't oblige me, I shall not think your stomach so much down as
 you say it is, and as, in this one particular, I think it ought to be.
 As to the state of things between my mother and me, you know enough of
 her temper, not to need to be told that she never espouses or resents
 with indifference. Yet will she not remember that I am her daughter. No,
 truly, I am all my papa's girl.
 She was very sensible, surely, of the violence of my poor father's
 temper, that she can so long remember that, when acts of tenderness and
 affection seem quite forgotten. Some daughters would be tempted to think
 that controul sat very heavy upon a mother, who can endeavour to exert
 the power she has over a child, and regret, for years after death, that
 she had not the same over a husband.
 If this manner of expression becomes not me of my mother, the fault will
 be somewhat extenuated by the love I always bore to my father, and by
 the reverence I shall ever pay to his memory: for he was a fond father,
 and perhaps would have been as tender a husband, had not my mother and
 he been too much of a temper to agree.
 The misfortune was, in short, that when one was out of humour, the
 other would be so too: yet neither of their tempers comparatively
 bad. Notwithstanding all which, I did not imagine, girl as I was in my
 father's life-time, that my mother's part of the yoke sat so heavy upon
 her neck as she gives me room to think it did, whenever she is pleased
 to disclaim her part of me.
 Both parents, as I have often thought, should be very careful, if they
 would secure to themselves the undivided love of their children, that,
 of all things, they should avoid such durable contentions with each
 other, as should distress their children in choosing their party, when
 they would be glad to reverence both as they ought.
