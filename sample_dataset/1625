all my calamities be at an end.
 But how I stray again; stray from my intention!  I would only have said,
 that I had begun a letter to my cousin Morden some time ago: but that now
 I can never end it.  You will believe I cannot: for how shall I tell him
 that all his compliments are misbestowed? that all his advice is thrown
 away? all his warnings vain? and that even my highest expectation is to
 be the wife of that free-liver, whom he so pathetically warns me to shun?
 Let me own, however, have your prayers joined with my own, (my fate
 depending, as it seems, upon the lips of such a man) 'that, whatever
 shall be my destiny, that dreadful part of my father's malediction, that
 I may be punished by the man in whom he supposes I put my confidence, may
 not take place! that this for Mr. Lovelace's own sake, and for the sake
 of human nature, may not be! or, if it be necessary, in support of the
 parental authority, that I should be punished by him, that it may not be
 by his premeditated or wilful baseness; but that I may be able to acquit
 his intention, if not his action!'  Otherwise, my fault will appear to be
 doubled in the eye of the event-judging world.  And yet, methinks, I
 would be glad that the unkindness of my father and uncles, whose hearts
 have already been too much wounded by my error, may be justified in every
 article, excepting in this heavy curse: and that my father will be
 pleased to withdraw that before it be generally known: at least the most
 dreadful part of it which regards futurity!
 I must lay down my pen.  I must brood over these reflections.  Once more,
 before I close my cousin's letter, I will peruse it.  And then I shall
 have it by heart.
 LETTER XX
 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE
 SUNDAY NIGHT, MAY 7.
 When you reflect upon my unhappy situation, which is attended with so
 many indelicate and even shocking circumstances, some of which my pride
