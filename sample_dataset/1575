could be substituted in the place of any one of her's but most abate of
 her perfection: And think you that I do not long to have your opinion of
 my fair prize?
 If you love to see features that glow, though the heart is frozen, and
 never yet was thawed; if you love fine sense, and adages flowing through
 teeth of ivory and lips of coral; an eye that penetrates all things; a
 voice that is harmony itself; an air of grandeur, mingled with a
 sweetness that cannot be described; a politeness that, if ever equaled,
 was never excelled--you'll see all these excellencies, and ten times
 more, in this my GLORIANA.
       Mark her majestic fabric!--She's a temple,
       Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine;
       Her soul the deity that lodges there:
       Nor is the pile unworthy of the god.
 Or, to describe her in a softer style with Rowe,
       The bloom of op'ning flow'rs, unsully'd beauty,
       Softness, and sweetest innocence she wears,
       And looks like nature in the world's first spring.
 Adieu, varlets four!--At six, on Monday evening, I expect ye all.
