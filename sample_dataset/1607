Charlotte, when I shall acquaint her with the affront thou puttest upon
 the whole sex, by asking, Whether I think my reward, when I have subdued
 the most charming woman in the world, will be equal to my trouble?--
 Which, thinkest thou, will a woman of spirit soonest forgive; the
 undervaluing varlet who can put such a question; or him, who prefers the
 pursuit and conquest of a fine woman to all the joys of life?  Have I not
 known even a virtuous woman, as she would be thought, vow everlasting
 antipathy to a man who gave out that she was too old for him to attempt?
 And did not Essex's personal reflection on Queen Elizabeth, that she was
 old and crooked, contribute more to his ruin than his treason?
 But another word or two, as to thy objection relating to my trouble and
 reward.
 Does not the keen fox-hunter endanger his neck and his bones in pursuit
 of a vermin, which, when killed, is neither fit food for men nor dogs?
 Do not the hunters of the noble game value the venison less than the
 sport?
 Why then should I be reflected upon, and the sex affronted, for my
 patience and perseverance in the most noble of all chases; and for not
 being a poacher in love, as thy question be made to imply?
 Learn of thy master, for the future, to treat more respectfully a sex
 that yields us our principal diversions and delights.
 Proceed anon.
 LETTER XVII
 MR. LOVELACE
 [IN CONTINUATION.]
 Well sayest thou, that mine is the most plotting heart in the world.
 Thou dost me honour; and I thank thee heartily.  Thou art no bad judge.
 How like Boileau's parson I strut behind my double chin!  Am I not
 obliged to deserve thy compliment?  And wouldst thou have me repent of a
 murder before I have committed it?
