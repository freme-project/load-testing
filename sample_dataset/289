upon the shelf for the interim."
 I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers
 of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that
 he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
 demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
 been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in
 the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler
 photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the
 Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
 the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle
 indeed which he could not unravel.
 I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
 conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
 find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
 to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
 Sutherland.
 A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
 attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at
 the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six
 o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a
 hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too
 late to assist at the d√©nouement of the little mystery. I found
 Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
 form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable
 array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell
 of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the
 chemical work which was so dear to him.
 "Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
 "Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
 "No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
