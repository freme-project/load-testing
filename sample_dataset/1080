granted for no longer time than till my cousin Morden comes; which, as I
 hope, cannot be long.
 I am afraid I must not venture to take the hint you give me, to deposit
 some of my clothes; although I will some of my linen, as well as papers.
 I will tell you why--Betty had for some time been very curious about my
 wardrobe, whenever I took out any of my things before her.
 Observing this, I once, on taking one of my garden-airings, left my keys
 in the locks: and on my return surprised the creature with her hand upon
 the keys, as if shutting the door.
 She was confounded at my sudden coming back. I took no notice: but on
 her retiring, I found my cloaths were not in the usual order.
 I doubted not, upon this, that her curiosity was owing to the orders she
 had received; and being afraid they would abridge me of my airings, if
 their suspicions were not obviated, it has ever since been my custom
 (among other contrivances) not only to leave my keys in the locks, but
 to employ the wench now-and-then in taking out my cloaths, suit by suit,
 on pretence of preventing their being rumpled or creased, and to see
 that the flowered silver suit did not tarnish: sometimes declaredly to
 give myself employment, having little else to do. With which employment
 (superadded to the delight taken by the low as well as by the high of
 our sex in seeing fine cloaths) she seemed always, I thought, as well
 pleased as if it answered one of the offices she had in charge.
 To this, and to the confidence they have in a spy so diligent, and
 to their knowing that I have not one confidant in a family in which
 nevertheless I believe every servant loves me; nor have attempted
 to make one; I suppose, I owe the freedom I enjoy of my airings: and
 perhaps (finding I make no movements towards going away) they are the
 more secure, that I shall at last be prevailed upon to comply with
 their measures: since they must think, that, otherwise, they give me
 provocation enough to take some rash step, in order to free myself
