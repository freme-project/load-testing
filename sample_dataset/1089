concerned for her; and doubly incensed against so vile a man.
      * It will be seen in Vol.I.Letter XXXIV. that Mr. Lovelace's
      motive for sparing his Rosebud was twofold. First, Because
      his pride was gratified by the grandmother's desiring him to
      spare her grand-daughter. Many a pretty rogue, say he, had I
      spared, whom I did not spare, had my power been
      acknowledged, and my mercy in time implored. But the
      debellare superbos should be my motto, were I to have a new
      one.
      His other motive will be explained in the following passage,
      in the same. I never was so honest, for so long together,
      says he, since my matriculation. It behoves me so to be.
      Some way or other my recess [at the little inn] may be found
      out, and it then will be thought that my Rosebud has
      attracted me. A report in my favour, from simplicities so
      amiable, may establish me, &c.
      Accordingly, as the reader will hereafter see, Mr. Lovelace
      finds by the effects, his expectations from the contrivance
      he set on foot by means of his agent Joseph Leman (who
      plays, as above, upon Betty Barnes) fully answered, though
      he could not know what passed on the occasion between the
      two ladies.
      This explanation is the more necessary to be given, as
      several of our readers (through want of due attention) have
      attributed to Mr. Lovelace, on his behaviour to his Rosebud,
      a greater merit than was due to him; and moreover imagined,
      that it was improbable, that a man, who was capable of
      acting so generously (as they supposed) in this instance,
      should be guilty of any atrocious vileness. Not considering,
      that love, pride, and revenge as he owns in Vol.I.Letter
