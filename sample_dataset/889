consequence be what it would.
 My brother thought fit to tell the good woman, that her whining nonsense
 did but harden me. There was a perverseness, he said, in female minds, a
 tragedy-pride, that would make a romantic young creature, such a one as
 me, risque any thing to obtain pity. I was of an age, and a turn [the
 insolent said] to be fond of a lover-like distress: and my grief (which
 she pleaded) would never break my heart: I should sooner break that of
 the best and most indulgent of mothers. He added, that she might once
 more go up to me: but that, if she prevailed not, he should suspect,
 that the man they all hated had found a way to attach her to his
 interest.
 Every body blamed him for this unworthy reflection; which greatly
 affected the good woman. But nevertheless he said, and nobody
 contradicted him, that if she could not prevail upon her sweet child,
 [as it seems she had fondly called me,] she had best draw to her own
 home, and there tarry till she was sent for; and so leave her sweet
 child to her father's management.
 Sure nobody had ever so insolent, so hard-hearted a brother, as I have!
 So much resignation to be expected from me! So much arrogance, and to so
 good a woman, and of so fine an understanding, to be allowed in him.
 She nevertheless told him, that however she might be ridiculed for
 speaking of the sweetness of my disposition, she must take upon herself
 to say, that there never was a sweeter in the sex: and that she had
 ever found, that my mild methods, and gentleness, I might at any time be
 prevailed upon, even in points against my own judgment and opinion.
 My aunt Hervey hereupon said, It was worth while to consider what
 Mrs. Norton said: and that she had sometimes allowed herself to doubt,
 whether I had been begun with by such methods as generous tempers are
 only to be influenced by, in cases where their hearts are supposed to be
 opposite to the will of their friends.
