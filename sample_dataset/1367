was, the distance of Windsor from Miss Howe, of whom I should be glad to
 be always within two or three hours reach of by messenger, if possible.
 If I had thoughts of any other place than Windsor, or nearer to
 Miss Howe, he wanted but my commands, and would seek for proper
 accommodations: but, fix as I pleased, farther or nearer, he had
 servants, and they had nothing else to do but to obey me.
 A grateful thing then he named to me--To send for my Hannah, as soon as
 I shall be fixed;* unless I would choose one of the young gentlewomen
 here to attend me; both of whom, as I had acknowledged, were very
 obliging; and he knew I had generosity enough to make it worth their
 while.
      * See his reasons for proposing Windsor, Letter XXV.--and her Hannah,
 Letter XXVI.
 This of Hannah, he might see, I took very well. I said I had thoughts
 of sending for her, as soon as I got to more convenient lodgings. As to
 these young gentlewomen, it were pity to break in upon that usefulness
 which the whole family were of to each other; each having her proper
 part, and performing it with an agreeable alacrity: insomuch, that I
 liked them all so well, that I could even pass my days among them, were
 he to leave me; by which means the lodgings would be more convenient to
 me than now they were.
 He need not repeat his objections to this place, he said: but as to
 going to Windsor, or wherever else I thought fit, or as to his personal
 attendance, or leaving me, he would assure me (he very agreeably said)
 that I could propose nothing in which I thought my reputation, and even
 my punctilio, concerned, that he would not cheerfully come into. And
 since I was so much taken up with my pen, he would instantly order his
 horse to be got ready, and would set out.
 Not to be off my caution. Have you any acquaintance at Windsor? said
 I.--Know you of any convenient lodgings there?
