averse to Mr. Solmes; and that, might you be left to your own choice,
 it would be the single life. As to himself, I plainly said, That you had
 great and just objections to him on the score of his careless morals:
 that it was surprising, that men who gave themselves the liberties he
 was said to take, should presume to think, that whenever they took it
 into their heads to marry, the most virtuous and worthy of the sex

 and prudence may make her in some cases, where she apprehends dangers to
 those she loves, is above fear, in points where her honour, and the true
