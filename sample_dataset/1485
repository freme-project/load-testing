obliged, by your means, to play the family off at Harlowe-place upon
 Mrs. Howe, and Mrs. Howe upon her daughter--Ah, Joseph! Little need for
 your fears for my angel! I only am in danger: but were I the free-liver
 I am reported to be, all this could I get over with a wet finger, as the

 But, by the help of one of your hints, I have thought of an expedient

 You may tell them, (still as from my servant,) that we are about to
 remove from inconvenient lodgings to others more convenient, (which is
 true,) and that I must be often absent from her.
 If they listen to your proposal, you will promote your interest with
 Betty, by telling it to her as a secret. Betty will tell Arabella of
