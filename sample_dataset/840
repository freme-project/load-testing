In short, Niece, we are in an embattled phalanx. Your reading makes you
 a stranger to nothing but what you should be most acquainted with. So
 you will see by that expression, that we are not to be pierced by your
 persuasions, and invincible persistence. We have agreed all to be
 moved, or none; and not to comply without one another. So you know your
 destiny; and have nothing to do but to yield to it.
 Let me tell you, the virtue of obedience lies not in obliging when you
 can be obliged again. But give up an inclination, and there is some
 merit in that.
 As to your expedient; you shall not come to my house, Miss Clary; though
 this is a prayer I little thought I ever should have denied you: for
 were you to keep your word as to seeing nobody but whom we please, yet
 can you write to somebody else, and receive letters from him. This we
 too well know you can, and have done--more is the shame and the pity!
 You offer to live single, Miss--we wished you married: but because you
 may not have the man your heart is set upon, why, truly, you will have
 nobody we shall recommend: and as we know, that somehow or other you
 correspond with him, or at least did as long as you could; and as he
 defies us all, and would not dare to do so, if he were not sure of you
 in spite of us all, (which is not a little vexatious to us, you must
 think,) we are resolved to frustrate him, and triumph over him, rather
 than that he should triumph over us: that's one word for all. So expect
 not any advocateship from me: I will not plead for you; and that's
 enough. From
 Your displeased uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.
 P.S. For the rest I refer to my brother Antony.
 TO ANTONY HARLOWE, ESQ. SATURDAY, MARCH 11.
 HONOURED SIR,
 As you have thought fit to favour Mr. Solmes with your particular
 recommendation, and was very earnest in his behalf, ranking him (as
