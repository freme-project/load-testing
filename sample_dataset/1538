may give him a pretence to try to engage me to dispense with his promise.
 But if I now do I must acquit him of it entirely.
 My approbation of his tender behaviour in the midst of my grief, has
 given him a right, as he seems to think, of addressing me with all the
 freedom of an approved lover.  I see by this man, that when once a woman
 embarks with this sex, there is no receding.  One concession is but the
 prelude to another with them.  He has been ever since Sunday last
 continually complaining of the distance I keep him at; and thinks himself
 entitled now to call in question my value for him; strengthening his
 doubts by my former declared readiness to give him up to a reconciliation
 with my friends; and yet has himself fallen off from that obsequious
 tenderness, if I may couple the words, which drew from me the concessions
 he builds upon.
 While we were talking at the door, my new servant came up with an
 invitation to us both to tea.  I said he might accept of it, if he
 pleased: but I must pursue my writing; and not choosing either tea or
 supper, I desired him to make my excuses below, as to both; and inform
 them of my choice to be retired as much as possible; yet to promise for
 me my attendance on the widow and her nieces at breakfast in the morning.
 He objected particularly in the eye of strangers as to avoiding supper.
 You know, said I, and you can tell them, that I seldom eat suppers.  My
 spirits are low.  You must never urge me against a declared choice.
 Pray, Mr. Lovelace, inform them of all my particularities.  If they are
 obliging, they will allow for them--I come not hither to make new
 acquaintance.
 I have turned over the books I found in my closet; and am not a little
 pleased with them; and think the better of the people of the house for
 their sakes.
