I write, because you enjoin me to do so. Love you still!--How can I
 help it, if I would? You may believe how I stand aghast, your letter
 communicating the first news--Good God of Heaven and Earth!--But what
 shall I say?--I am all impatient for particulars.
 Lord have mercy upon me!--But can it be?
 My mother will indeed be astonished!--How can I tell it her!--It was
 but last night (upon some jealousies put into her head by your foolish
 uncle) that I assured her, and this upon the strength of your own
 assurances, that neither man nor devil would be able to induce you to
 take a step that was in the least derogatory to the most punctilious
 honour.
 But, once more, can it be? What woman at this rate!--But, God preserve
 you!
 Let nothing escape you in your letters. Direct them for me, however, to
 Mrs. Knolly's, till further notice.
 *****
 Observe, my dear, that I don't blame you by all this--Your relations
 only are in fault!--Yet how you came to change your mind is the
 surprising thing.
 How to break it to my mother, I know not. Yet if she hear it first
 from any other, and find I knew it before, she will believe it to be my
 connivance!--Yet, as I hope to live, I know not how to break it to her.
 But this is teasing you.--I am sure, without intention.
 Let me now repeat my former advice--If you are not married by this time,
 be sure delay not the ceremony. Since things are as they are, I wish it
 were thought that you were privately married before you went away. If
 these men plead AUTHORITY to our pain, when we are theirs--Why should we
 not, in such a case as this, make some good out of the hated word, for
 our reputation, when we are induced to violate a more natural one?
 Your brother and sister [that vexes me almost as much as any thing!]
