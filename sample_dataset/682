 You see, my dear, I made not the pleas I might have made.
 My brother seemed ready to give a loose to his passion: My father put
 on the countenance which always portends a gathering storm: My uncles
 mutteringly whispered: And my sister aggravatingly held up her hands.
 While I begged to be heard out:--And my mother said, let the child, that

 were effected between my family and his, he must not expect that I would
 countenance his visits, much less give him an opportunity of that sort.
 I told him further, that Miss Howe so well understood my mind, that she
 never left me a moment while Mr. Lovelace was there: that when he came,
 if I was not below in the parlour, I would not suffer myself to be
 called to him: although I thought it would be an affectation which would

 they not further points to carry by intimidating me. All this made it
 evident, as I mentioned above, that they themselves expected not my
